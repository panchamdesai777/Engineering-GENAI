718413_2020.htm,718413,2020,"Item 1. The Business
Organization and Operation
The Company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Vermont in 1982 and became a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, in October 1983 when it acquired all of the voting shares of the Bank, headquartered in Derby, Vermont. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company and principally all of the Company’s business operations are presently conducted through it. Therefore, the following narrative and the other information about the Company contained in this report are based primarily on the Bank’s operations.
The Bank; Banking Services. Community National Bank was organized in 1851 as the Peoples Bank, and was subsequently reorganized as the National Bank of Derby Line in 1865. In 1975, after 110 continuous years of operation as the National Bank of Derby Line, the Bank acquired the Island Pond National Bank and changed its name to “Community National Bank.” On December 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of LyndonBank, a Vermont bank headquartered in Lyndonville, Vermont, in a cash merger transaction. As a result of the merger, the Company expanded its existing branch network in Caledonia and Orleans Counties and extended it into Lamoille and Franklin Counties. In addition to its main office in Derby, the Company currently maintains eleven branch offices in northeastern and central Vermont and loan production offices in Chittenden County, in northwestern Vermont, and Grafton County, in western New Hampshire.
The opportunities for growth continue to be primarily in the Central Vermont and Chittenden County markets where economic activity is more robust than in the Company’s Orleans and Caledonia County markets, and where the Company is increasing its presence and market share. The Company is also focusing on expanding its presence in the neighboring state of New Hampshire through the opening of its loan production office in Lebanon, New Hampshire in 2019.
The Company, through the Bank, provides a broad range of loan and deposit services to the residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations and municipalities in its northern and central Vermont markets. Significant services offered by the Company include:
·
Business Banking - The Company offers a range of credit products for a variety of general business purposes, including financing for commercial business properties, equipment, inventories and accounts receivable, as well as letters of credit. The Company also offers business checking and other deposit accounts, cash management services, repurchase agreements, ACH and wire transfer services, card processing and remote deposit capture.
·
Commercial Real Estate Lending - The Company provides a range of products to meet the financing needs of commercial developers and investors, residential builders and developers and community development entities. Credit products are available to facilitate the purchase of land and/or build structures for business use and for investors who are developing residential or commercial property, as well as for real estate secured financing of existing businesses. The Bank has previously been recognized by the SBA as Vermont’s top Section 7(a) program lender, providing financing to startups and other small businesses not eligible for more traditional financing, and as one of Vermont’s top third party small business lenders under the SBA’s Section 504 loan program.
·
Residential Real Estate Lending - The Company provides products to help meet the home financing needs of consumers, including conventional permanent and construction/permanent (fixed, adjustable, or variable rate) financing arrangements, and FHA/VA loan products. The Company offers both fixed-rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage (ARM) loans and home equity loans. A portion of the first lien residential mortgage loans originated by the Company are sold into the secondary market. The Company offers these products through its network of banking and loan production offices. The Company does not originate subprime residential real estate loans.
·
Retail Credit - The Company provides a full-range of loan products to meet the needs of consumers, including personal loans, automobile loans and boat/recreational vehicle loans. In addition, through a marketing alliance with a third party, the Company offers credit cards.
·
Municipal and Institutional Banking - The Company provides banking services to meet the needs of state and local governments, schools, charities, membership and not-for-profit associations including deposit account services, tax-exempt loans, lines of credit and term loans. In addition, through an arrangement with the FHLBB, the Company offers a secured deposit product to its municipal customers, collateralized by FHLBB letters of credit.
·
Retail Banking - The Company provides a full-range of consumer banking services, including checking accounts, savings programs, ATMs, debit/credit cards, night deposit facilities and online, mobile and telephone banking.
The Company focuses on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with customers and is committed to providing for the financial services needs of the communities it serves. In particular, the Company continues to emphasize its relationships with individual customers and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The Company actively evaluates the banking needs of its markets, including low- and moderate-income areas, and offers products that are responsive to the needs of its customer base. The Company’s markets provide a mix of real estate, commercial and industrial, municipal and consumer lending opportunities, as well as a stable core deposit base. Additional information about our business, including the Company’s deposit-taking activities, lending activities and credit and risk management policies, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in the 2020 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Related Trust Company. In 2002, the Bank transferred its trust operations to a newly formed Vermont-chartered non-depository trust and investment management company, CFSG, based in Newport, Vermont. The Bank’s ownership interest in CFSG is held indirectly, through CFS Partners, a Vermont limited liability company, which owns 100% of the limited liability company equity interests of CFSG. Immediately following transfer of its trust operations to CFSG, the Bank sold a two-thirds interest in CFS Partners, equally to the National Bank of Middlebury, headquartered in Middlebury, Vermont and Guaranty Bancorp Inc., the bank holding company parent of Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank, headquartered in Woodsville, New Hampshire. CFSG offers fiduciary services throughout the market areas of the three owner financial institutions and leases space from them in some of their branch offices, including at the Bank’s facilities in Barre and Lyndonville, Vermont.
Statutory Business Trust. In 2007, the Company formed CMTV Statutory Trust I (the Trust), a Delaware statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing $12.5 million of trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company. This funding provided a portion of the cash consideration paid by the Company in the acquisition of LyndonBank and provided additional regulatory capital. The Trust is a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, within the meaning of applicable accounting standards. Accordingly, the Trust is not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.
Competition
All of the Bank’s full-service banking offices are located in northern and central Vermont. The Bank’s main office is located in Derby, in Orleans County. In addition to its main office, the Bank has four other banking offices in Orleans County, one office in Essex County, two offices in Caledonia County, two offices in Washington County and one office each in Franklin and Lamoille Counties. The Bank also maintains loan production offices in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire. (See Part I, Item 2 (Properties) of this report.)
The Bank competes in all aspects of its business with other banks and credit unions in northern and central Vermont, including three of the largest banks operating in the state, which maintain branch offices throughout the Bank’s service area. The Bank also competes with bank and non-bank lenders in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire where it maintains loan production offices. Changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry during the past decade have broadened the competition for commercial bank products, such as deposits and loans, to include not only traditional rivals such as banks, savings banks and credit unions, but also many non-traditional rivals such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual funds and consumer and commercial finance and leasing companies. In addition, many out-of-market nationwide banks, nonbank lenders and other financial service firms operate in the Company’s market areas through mass marketing solicitations by mail, radio, television, the internet and email. At the same time, technological changes have facilitated remote delivery of financial services by bank and nonbank competitors outside the context of a traditional branch bank network, thereby intensifying competition from out-of-market firms. This trend may accelerate, as customers’ use of and reliance on technology for remote delivery of financial services has accelerated as a result of the limitations imposed on in-person banking during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition from the tax-exempt credit union industry has also intensified in recent years. A number of the Bank’s credit union competitors, including the largest state-chartered Vermont credit union, have converted from an employment based common bond to a community common bond, thereby significantly increasing their fields of membership in the Bank’s market areas. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, they have a significant pricing advantage over commercial banks for their deposit and loan products. This pricing advantage, coupled with the relaxing of membership criteria and regulatory restrictions on product offerings, has resulted in increased competition for the Bank from this tax exempt sector of the financial services industry.
In order to compete with other bank and non-bank service providers, the Company stresses the community orientation of its banking operations and relies to a large extent upon personal relationships established by its officers, directors and employees with their customers and on their strong ties to the local community. In addition, management’s knowledge of the local community assists it in tailoring the Company’s products and services to meet the needs of its customer base. Although competition is strong throughout the Company’s market area, management believes that the Company can continue to compete effectively, in view of its local market knowledge and community ties and its understanding of customer needs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any employees at the holding company level. However, as of such date, the Bank employed 126 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. The Bank provides our full-time and part-time employees with a comprehensive employee benefit package, including medical benefits, life insurance and a 401K retirement savings plan. Additionally, full-time employees also have disability insurance as part of their benefit package. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management of the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Supervision
The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks, to which the Company and the Bank are subject. Regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to below. Banking is a highly regulated business and proposals to change the laws and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank is impossible to predict with any certainty.
The following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the particular statutes and regulations.
Bank Holding Company Act. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to on-going regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). A bank holding company for example, must generally obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank. FRB approval is also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property.
The Act generally limits the activity in which the Company and its subsidiaries may engage to certain specified activities, including those activities which the FRB may find, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking are: (1) making and servicing loans that could be made by mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring companies; (2) performing the functions of a trust company; (3) certain leasing of real or personal property; (4) providing certain financial, banking or economic data processing services; (5) except as otherwise prohibited by law, acting as an insurance agent or broker with respect to insurance that is directly related to the extension of credit or the provision of other financial services or, under certain circumstances, with respect to insurance that is sold in certain small communities in which the bank holding company system maintains banking offices; (6) acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance and credit health and accident insurance directly related to extensions of credit by the holding company system; (7) providing certain kinds of management consulting advice to unaffiliated banks and non-bank depository institutions; (8) performing real estate appraisals; (9) issuing and selling money order and similar instruments and travelers checks and selling U.S. Savings Bonds; (10) providing certain securities brokerage and related services for the account of bank customers; (11) underwriting and dealing in certain government obligations and other obligations such as bankers’ acceptances and certificates of deposit; (12) providing consumer financial counseling; (13) providing tax planning and preparation services; (14) providing check guarantee services to merchants; (15) operating a collection agency; and (16) operating a credit bureau. Trust and investment management activities conducted through a non-depository trust company such as the Company’s affiliate, CFSG, are also considered by the FRB to be permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking.
Except for CFSG’s trust and investment management operations, the Company does not presently engage, directly or indirectly through any affiliate, in any other permissible non-banking activities.
A bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval in order to purchase or redeem its own stock if the gross consideration to be paid, when added to the net consideration paid by the company for all purchases or redemptions by the company of its equity securities within the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.
The Company is required to file with the FRB annual and quarterly reports and such additional information as the Board may require pursuant to the Act. The Board may also make examinations of the Company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company.
The Company, the Bank, CFS Partners and CFSG are all considered “affiliates” of each other for the purposes of Section 18(j) of the FDIA, as amended, and Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in on January 1, 2019, for the Company and the Bank.
The Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:
●
a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
●
a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
●
a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, have retained the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, consisting of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company and the Bank satisfied this fully-phased in capital conservation buffer. Failure to maintain the required buffer would result in limitations on permissible shareholder distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
The Company’s capital ratios exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2020. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies adopted an interim rule temporarily lowering the CBLR benchmark to in excess of 8%, rather than 9%, with a phased increase of the CBLR back to the 9% level by the end of 2021. The Company and Bank continued to qualify to utilize the CBLR framework as of December 31, 2020, however, as noted in Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2020, they had not elected to do so.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. SOX was enacted to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. SOX and the SEC’s implementing regulations include provisions addressing, among other matters, the duties, functions and qualifications of audit committees for all public companies; certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except (in the case of banking companies) loans in the normal course of business; expedited filing requirements for reports of beneficial ownership of company stock by insiders; disclosure of a code of ethics for senior officers, and of any change or waiver of such code; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; auditor independence; disclosure of fees paid to the company’s auditors for non-audit services and limitations on the provision of such services; attestation requirements for company management and external auditors, relating to internal controls and procedures; and various increased criminal penalties for violations of federal securities laws.
Since 2007 Section 404 of SOX has required management of the Company to undertake a periodic assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for 2020 is contained in Part II, Item 9A of this Report. Effective December 31, 2020, as a non-accelerated filer for SEC reporting purposes, the Company is no longer required to obtain from its external auditors an attestation on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of these controls under Section 404(b) of SOX. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs in connection with its on-going compliance with Section 404.
Information on the Company’s corporate governance practices, including committee charters, is available on the Company’s website at www.communitybancorpvt.com.
SEC Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. Under current SEC reporting and disclosure rules, as amended in 2018, and 2020, the Company is once again considered to be a non-accelerated filer and a smaller reporting company. As noted above, due to this change in filing status, the Company is no longer subject to the requirements in SOX section 404(b) to obtain an external auditor attestation of management’s assessment of the Company’s internal controls and their effectiveness. In addition, the Company is no longer required to file its periodic reports with the SEC on the accelerated timetable applicable to accelerated filers. As a smaller reporting company, the Company is permitted to make certain reduced (or scaled) financial and other disclosures in its periodic reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC.
Dividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank’s ALL.
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.
The FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.
The CARES Act and Other Initiatives Related to COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which provided approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the CARES Act’s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of financial institutions like the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the FRB and other federal bank regulatory authorities. These rules and other subsequent regulatory initiatives have provided guidance on the implementation, eligibility requirements and terms of the various CARES Act programs, as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. It is possible that Congress will enact additional COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act, including the PPP and guidance on certain TDRs discussed below, as well as other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act amended the SBA’s loan programs to create the PPP, a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans, which bear a mandated fixed annual interest rate of one percent, are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, no collateral or personal guarantees are required. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” (the “CAA”) that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the “HHSB Act”). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. The Bank has participated in both rounds of PPP lending.
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers. The CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that may otherwise be required to be characterized as TDRs and to suspend any related determination if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications are related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurs between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency or January 1, 2022. During 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19. The Bank has followed this guidance in providing relief to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Effect on Regulatory Capital. On September 29, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that neutralizes the regulatory capital and liquidity coverage ratio effects of participating in certain COVID-19 liquidity facilities due to the fact there is no credit or market risk associated with exposures pledged to such facilities. As a result, the final rule supports the flow of credit to households and businesses affected by COVID-19.
Dodd-Frank Act. Although the 2008 financial crisis has now passed, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) will continue to affect the Company’s operations as it represents a comprehensive revision and restructuring of many aspects of the financial services industry. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to reduce systemic risk from large, complex “systemically significant” financial institutions, and thus do not apply to a smaller banking organization such as the Company. Nevertheless, certain of its provisions do directly apply to the Company and others indirectly impact its operations, as the Dodd-Frank Act continues to reshape the financial services environment. Among other things, the Act:
·
Established a new independent agency, the CFPB, with centralized responsibility for implementing and (with respect to large organizations) enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB does not have enforcement or examination authority over smaller banking organizations such as the Company, many of its regulatory standards and mandates apply to them, with enforcement authority vested in other regulatory agencies such as (with respect to the Bank) the OCC;
·
Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial companies on a consolidated basis. These changes prohibit the use of additional trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, but the Company’s existing trust preferred securities are grandfathered;
·
Requires debit card interchange transaction fees charged by large financial institutions to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. The FRB adopted regulations in 2011 establishing such fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limiting restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Although smaller institutions such as the Company are not subject to the interchange fee restrictions, it is possible that, over time, competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace may operate to make the restrictions applicable to them by default;
·
Requires public companies to periodically seek “say on executive pay” and “say on frequency” votes of shareholders, and in some circumstances, a “say on golden parachute” vote of shareholders. These vote requirements first became applicable for the Company’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders, with the next “say on pay” vote scheduled to take place at the 2022 Annual Meeting of shareholders;
·
Allowed depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011;
·
Established by statute the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine mandating holding company financial support of subsidiary insured depository institutions;
·
Eliminated state restrictions on de novo interstate branching;
·
Established new requirements related to residential mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. Many of these provisions have been implemented through CFPB rulemakings;
·
Weakened federal preemption standards for national banks and federal savings associations and their operating subsidiaries by granting states greater authority to enforce consumer protection laws against them;
·
Provided permanent relief for non-accelerated filers, from the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for auditor attestation of management’s assessment of internal controls and their effectiveness;
·
Requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive regulatory approval of an interstate bank acquisition; and
·
Permanently increased the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, changed the FDIC insurance assessment base to assets rather than deposits and increased the reserve ratio for the DIF to ensure the future strength of the fund.
OCC Supervision. As a national banking association, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and federal and state statutes and rules and regulations applicable to national banks. The primary supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by the OCC and must file periodic reports with the OCC containing a complete statement of its financial condition and results of operations. The OCC’s examinations are designed for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.
In 2011, the CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, took over responsibility for implementing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others. However, financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our Bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our Bank subsidiary, the OCC). The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.
Prompt Corrective Action. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements established under FDICIA. Among other things, FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lessor of 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was considered “well capitalized” under FDICIA’s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
Safety and Soundness Regulations. Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify, monitor, and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the safety and soundness regulations include enforcement provisions, including authority for the bank regulatory agencies to require a financial institution in some circumstances to create and implement a compliance plan.
Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, previously all FDIC insured depository institutions were required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The FDIC discontinued collection of these payments in March 2019.
The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment formula for determining deposit insurance premiums and modified certain insurance coverage provisions of the FDIA. The FDIC’s implementing rules, which redefined the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, became effective April 1, 2011. The Bank’s total FDIC insurance assessment for 2020 was $300,643.
The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 the maximum per depositor FDIC insurance amount.
Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA’s prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the “one-way” purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling approximately $4.9 million in exchanged funds and $0 in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits. The Company had $4.2 million in purchased wholesale deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Asset, Liability and Funds Management Policy limits the use of brokered deposits to 5% of total assets.
USA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cooperatively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. The Secretary of the Treasury and federal banking regulators have adopted several regulations to implement these provisions. The Act also amended the federal Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations. As required by law, the Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance program, as well as a customer identification program. (See “BSA/AML Requirements” below.)
BSA/AML Requirements. The Company is subject to a number of AML and regulations as a result of being a U.S.-based financial institution. AML requirements are primarily derived from the BSA, as amended by the USA Patriot Act. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the financial system from being used by criminals to hide illicit proceeds and to impede terrorists’ ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, BSA/AML laws and regulations require financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. The Company maintains an AML program designed to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to AML and anti-terrorist financing initiatives. The AML program provides for a system of internal controls to ensure that appropriate due diligence and, when necessary, enhanced due diligence, including obtaining and maintaining appropriate documentation, is conducted at account opening and updated, as necessary, through the course of the client relationship. The AML program is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the AML program requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the AML program is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Non-compliance with BSA/AML laws or failure to maintain adequate policies and procedures can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a bank merger, bank holding company acquisition or other certain other activities.
AML customer due diligence requirements became effective on May 11, 2018. Among other things, these new regulations require the Company to collect information on the beneficial ownership and controlling person of legal entity clients and to verify their identity.
The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities, or countries, identified as “Specially Designated Nationals,” such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These rules require the blocking of assets held by, and prohibit transfers of property to such individuals, entities or countries. Blocked assets, such as property or bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Company maintains an OFAC program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements.
Financial Privacy. Under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 all financial institutions, including the Company, are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic consumer customer data with nonaffiliated parties, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. The Company is also subject to similar, but more stringent, requirements under state law, including the Vermont Financial Privacy Act. In addition, the Company is subject to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, including the amendments adopted in the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). The FACT Act includes many provisions concerning national credit reporting standards and permits consumers to opt out of information sharing among affiliated companies for marketing purposes. It also requires financial institutions to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit terms less favorable than those generally available. The CFPB has extensive rulemaking authority under the FACT Act and has promulgated rules implementing the Act, including rules limiting information sharing for affiliate marketing and rules requiring programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Vermont Fair Credit Reporting Act, which generally requires an individual’s consent in order to obtain a credit report.
Qualified Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB adopted significant amendments to the regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act. These amendments became effective in January 2014, and address mortgage origination practices by certain housing creditors, including the Bank. These 2014 regulations generally require mortgage lenders to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate so-called qualified mortgages, or “QMs”, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, under the 2014 regulations, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, the points and fees paid by a consumer do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio is no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency).
In December, 2020, the CFPB adopted two rules significantly revising the QM requirements. Among other changes, the first of the new rules simplifies the definition of a QM by creating conclusive and rebuttable presumptions regarding the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the rule, a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate (APR) does not exceed the average prime offer rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set. A loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate exceeds the APOR for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more but by less than 2.25 percentage points. The second of the new CFPB rules creates a new category of “Seasoned QMs” for first-lien, fixed-rate covered transactions that have met certain performance requirements, are held in portfolio by the originating creditor or first purchaser for a 36-month period, comply with general restrictions on product features and points and fees, and meet certain underwriting requirements. A mortgage loan that qualifies as a Seasoned QM loan will receive a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements. The new rules became effective on March 1, 2021, with an initial mandatory effective date of July 1, 2021. On March 3, 2021 the CFPB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to extend the mandatory compliance date to October 1, 2021.
A lender originating a QM is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay requirement, whereas a lender originating a mortgage that is not a QM is exposed to the risk of a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules. Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rules could require the lender to pay damages to the borrower, and could impair the lender’s ability to enforce the loan terms or foreclose on the real estate collateral.
Integrated TILA/RESPA (TRID) Disclosures. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued rules revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the RESPA and TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective in October 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate (which combines content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA) not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure (which combines content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA) at least three days prior to the loan closing. Other significant changes included in the TRID rules include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures. As with the CFPB’s ability-to-repay/QM rules, compliance with the TRID rules has increased the Company’s compliance costs and may adversely affect the profitability of our routine residential mortgage lending operations.
Community Reinvestment Act. The federal CRArequires banks to define the communities they serve, identify the credit needs of those communities, collect and maintain data for each small business or small farm loan originated or purchased by the Bank, and maintain a public file at each location. The federal banking regulators examine the institutions they regulate to assess their record of meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, and assign one of the following four ratings: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance”. As of the Bank’s last CRA examination, completed by the OCC during 2020, it received a rating of “Outstanding”.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The federal HMDA, which is implemented by CFPB’s Regulation C, requires mortgage lenders that maintain offices within MSAs to report and make available to the public specified information regarding their residential mortgage lending activities, such as the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the “rate spread” between the interest rate on loans and certain treasury securities and other benchmarks. The Bank became subject to HMDA reporting requirements as a result of its merger with LyndonBank in 2007, as the former LyndonBank branch in Enosburg Falls in Franklin County is included within the Burlington, Vermont MSA. The CFPB’s HMDA rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, many consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit. HMDA rule amendments that became effective January 1, 2018 significantly increased the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. However, the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provided an exemption from the requirement to collect these additional data fields for banks that have at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating that originate fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans or fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit per year. The Bank qualifies for this relief.
Flood Insurance Reform. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
In July 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires certain lenders to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. New rules effective July 1, 2019, require banks and other regulated financial institutions to accept certain private insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies.
Reserve Requirements. FRB Regulation D requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (generally, demand deposits, NOW accounts and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties) and non-personal time deposits (generally, money market deposit accounts or other savings deposits held by corporations or other depositors that are not natural persons, and certain other types of time deposits), subject to certain exemptions, at a level established by the FRB. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at the FRBB or a pass through account (as defined by the FRB), the effect of maintaining required reserves is to reduce the amount of the Company’s interest-bearing assets. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the required reserve ratio to 0 percent, thereby eliminating the reserve requirement. However, the FRB retains the authority to reimpose a reserve requirement in the future.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the applicable regional FHLB (the FHLBB, in the case of the Bank), in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year and 4.5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLBB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock at December 31, 2020 of $768,400. As a member, the Bank is subject to future capital calls by the FHLBB in order to maintain compliance with its capital plan.
FRB Executive Compensation Guidelines. The FRB has issued comprehensive guidance on executive compensation policies, intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially an institution’s risk profile, either individually or as part of a group, and establishes that incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to identify and manage effectively; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. The guidance instructed institutions to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and implement corrective programs as needed. Where deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements exist, they must be immediately addressed. For institutions such as the Company that are not “large, complex banking organizations” as defined in the guidance, the FRB will review the incentive compensation arrangements as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process and not in a separate examination. These examinations will be tailored to the scope and complexity of the institution’s activity and compensation arrangements. The findings will be included in the FRB’s examination report and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the institution fails to take prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. In addition to the statutes, regulations and regulatory initiatives described above, new legislation and regulations affecting financial institutions are frequently proposed. If enacted or adopted, these measures could change banking statutes and the Company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and could further increase reporting and compliance requirements, governance structures and costs of doing business. The Company cannot predict whether any such additional legislation or other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or the effect they may have on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money supply, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government Securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings, setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits, regulating interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits and expanding or contracting the money supply. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Before deciding to invest in the Company or to maintain or increase an investment, investors should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below and in the Company’s other filings with the SEC are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that are currently deemed immaterial may emerge or evolve and also affect the Company’s business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which in turn could result in a decline in the value of the Company’s capital stock.
ECOMONIC AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS
The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive to us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be significant. Moreover, the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and out of our control, and will be affected by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the national and global economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 initially caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of business and social events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability throughout our Vermont markets and nationwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Vermont, as well as the governments in most other states, took preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including, among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, real estate and the health care industry, and resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees in Vermont and nationwide.
Although we continued operating during mandated shutdowns in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions in the future. Impacts to our business have included the implementation of additional health and safety precautions at our banking offices, the transition of a portion of our workforce to home locations, curtailed in-branch services, increases in customers’ inability to make scheduled loan payments, increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications, and an adverse effect on accounting estimates that we use to determine our provision and allowance for loan losses.
While the CARES Act signed into law in March, 2020 provided fast and direct economic assistance for American workers, families, and small businesses during 2020, helping to minimize the immediate impact of the pandemic, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the broader economy and our markets are not known, nor is the ultimate duration or impacts of the economic and social restrictions resulting from government mitigation efforts. Moreover, the responsive actions taken by the FRB to lower the federal funds rate has negatively affected our interest income and, therefore, may adversely affect our earnings, financial condition, results of operation and prospects in future periods. Additional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:
●
decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings;
●
declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral resulting in higher loan losses;
●
declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;
●
declines in demand resulting from businesses and individuals suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets.
●
our employees contracting COVID-19;
●
reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;
●
a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;
●
unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;
●
effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;
●
sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;
●
declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;
●
substantial increases in unemployment in our markets;
●
reduced consumer spending due to job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;
●
unprecedented volatility in U.S. financial markets ;and
●
volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio.
These factors, together or in combination with other factors, events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, in both the short-term and the long-term. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may continue to materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services, and could negatively impact, among other things, our asset quality, liquidity, regulatory capital, net income and growth prospects.
Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FRB lowered the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25%. It is unclear how long this historically low target federal funds rate will remain in effect. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may compress, reducing our net interest income and adversely affecting our operating results. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.
Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates.
In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, as discussed below, there is uncertainty as to our future interest costs on our subordinated debentures due to the scheduled phase out of LIBOR at the end of 2021. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.
Our interest costs may increase as a result of the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a reference rate for interest payments on our subordinated debentures.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that LIBOR would no longer be published, with an expected target date of December 31, 2021 for the phase out. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced firm target dates for the phase out of various LIBOR settings, including a phase out date of June 30, 2023 for 3-month LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a “benchmark” or “reference rate” for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are significant conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal Financial Stability Oversight Committee has stated that the end or waning use of LIBOR has the potential to significantly disrupt trading in many important types of financial contracts.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding $12,887,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2037, which bear a quarterly floating rate of interest equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus 2.85%. Under the terms of the Indenture, if 3-month LIBOR is not available, the Trustee may obtain substitute quotations from four leading banks in the London interbank market for their offered rate to prime banks in the London market for U.S. dollar deposits having a three month maturity; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are received, the Trustee will request substitute quotations from four major New York City banks for their offered rate to leading European banks for loans in U.S. dollars; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. The Debenture Trustee has not yet informed the Company as to how it intends to proceed. Phase out of LIBOR, including the Debenture Trustee’s implementation of the foregoing provisions, could significantly impact the Company’s interest costs on its Debentures and it is not possible to predict the magnitude of any such increase.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
As a participating lender in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), the Company is subject to additional risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties and risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding the processing of PPP loans.
We are a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We originated $105.0 million in PPP loans during 2020, of which $64.3 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020, and we continue to make new loans during 2021 under the PPP, as extended by the CAA. Under the PPP, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the program. There is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, some other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any financial liability, regulatory enforcement, litigation costs or reputational damage stemming from our participation in the PPP and any related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan. If the SBA identifies a deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty for the affected loan or loans, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.
We are subject to liquidity risk because we rely primarily on deposit-gathering to satisfy our funding needs.
Our primary source of liquidity is through the growth of deposits, which provide low cost funding for our operations. If we are unable to attract enough deposits in our market area to fund loan growth and our other funding needs, then we may be forced to purchase deposits or to borrow through the FHLBB or in the capital markets. Purchased deposits and borrowings would tend to be more expensive than funding through core deposits and therefore could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and regulatory capital levels.
We are subject to credit risk and if our ALL is not adequate to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.
We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower’s default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the credit. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In loan default situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan, through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan could exceed the value of the collateral acquired.
We periodically make a determination of the adequacy of our ALL based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by loan risk ratings, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accruing and criticized loans. Management relies on its loan officers and credit quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the provision required for the allowance. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, previously incorrect assumptions, an increase in defaulted loans, or other pertinent factors, we determine that additional increases in the ALL are necessary, additional expenses may be incurred. During 2020, in evaluating our ALL we downgraded certain qualitative factors and shortened our historical lookback period from five years to one year, in light of the adverse economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Determining the amount of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. At any time, we are likely to have loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. The OCC, our subsidiary Bank’s primary federal regulator, reviews the loan portfolio from time to time as part of its regulatory examination and may request that we increase the ALL. Changes in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, we will need to make additional provisions to restore the allowance. Any provisions to increase or restore the ALL would decrease our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Implementation of CECL could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements upon adoption as it may result in the recording of an increased ALL amount, with a related adverse impact on the calculation of the Company’s regulatory capital ratios. Adoption of the CECL model will become mandatory for the Company beginning with the 2023 fiscal year.
Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.
Generally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers’ discretion and may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including changes in prevailing interest rates. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. The prevailing low interest rates increase our prepayment risk. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our loans and deposits are geographically concentrated and adverse local economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
Unlike many larger banking institutions, our banking operations are not geographically diversified. Substantially all of our loans, deposits and fee income are generated in northeastern and central Vermont. As a result, poor economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont could adversely and significantly impact the demand for loans and our other financial products and services and may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. Much of our market area is located in the poorest region of the state. Economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont are subject to various uncertainties, to a greater degree than certain other regions of the state. If economic conditions in our market area decline, we expect that our level of problem assets would increase and our prospects for growth would be impaired.
Systems failures, interruptions, cyberattacks or other breaches of information security, including those affecting our vendors, could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
We depend upon data processing, software, communication, and information access and exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Consequently, we are subject to certain related operational risks, both in our operations and through those of our service providers. These risks include, but are not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud, cyberattacks and catastrophic failures resulting from civil unrest, terrorist acts or natural disasters. Despite the safeguards we maintain, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. Information security risks have increased significantly due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking channels by customers and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Our technologies, systems and networks and those of certain of our service providers as well as our customers’ devices, may be the target of cyberattacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, the theft of customer assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and we could be exposed to claims from customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition. While we have instituted safeguards and controls, we cannot provide assurance that they will be effective in all cases, and their failure in some circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.
In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate or incomplete, we may suffer financial or reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.
Environmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.
In the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
REGULATORY, LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING RISKS
Our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and to service our debt depends primarily on dividends from our subsidiary and may be subject to regulatory and contractual limitations.
As a holding company, our cash flow typically comes from dividends that our bank subsidiary, Community National Bank, pays to us. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and to service our subordinated debentures, depends on the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to federal statutory and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings and may be subject to additional prudential considerations, such as capital planning needs. In addition, FRB policy, which applies to us as a registered bank holding company, provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period and should not be paid if regulatory capital levels are deemed insufficient. Further, regulatory capital requirements could curtail our ability to pay dividends in some cases if we do not maintain a required capital conservation buffer. Our failure to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or our failure to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if sufficient dividend funding from the Bank is not available to cover all our requirements, we would be obligated first to pay interest and, if applicable, principal on our debentures and then to pay dividends on our preferred stock before making any dividend payments on our common stock.
Although we have generally paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future or that the dividend rate will not be reduced in future periods.
Our banking business is highly regulated, and we may be adversely affected by changes in law and regulation.
We are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCC. Federal laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital, the permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The OCC possesses the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to its supervision, and the FRB possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. We are also subject to certain state laws, including certain Vermont laws designed to protect consumers of banking products and services. These and other federal and state laws and restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.
Our business is highly regulated and the various federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance, policies and interpretations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. It is impossible to predict the nature of such changes or their competitive impact on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our banking operations in particular. Such changes may, among other things, increase our cost of doing business, limit our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, litigation by private parties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.
We report certain assets, including investment securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. For example, we could be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.
Changes in accounting standards could materially affect our financial statements.
From time to time FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements and applicable disclosures in our SEC filings. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Implementation of accounting changes, with associated professional consultation and advice, can be costly, even if the change will not have any material effect on our financial statements.
Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management has designed and implemented, and periodically reviews and updates, our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. However, any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to detailed capital requirements and cannot ensure that we will qualify for simplified capital calculations in any future period.
As of January 1, 2015, we were required to comply with the Base III capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The capital rules require the Bank and the Company to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions in order to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2020. The Base III capital rules permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. Our trust preferred securities qualify for this grandfather treatment. The rules also increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations, but retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. These standards could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Under the rules, we were permitted to make, and did make, a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital.
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020 and although the Company and Bank qualify to utilize the CBLR framework at December 31, 2020, management has not elected to do so at this time.
We may be required to write down goodwill.
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill totaled approximately $11.6 million, created in connection with the LyndonBank acquisition in 2007. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of this asset to fair value. We conduct a review each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We last completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2020, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK
Our common stock is not exchange-listed and our trading volume is less than that of larger public companies, which can contribute to volatility in our stock price and adversely affect the price and liquidity of an investment in our common stock.
Our common stock is included in the OTC QX market tier maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the trading symbol CMTV, but is not traded on any securities exchange. Bid and ask quotations and trades in our stock made by certain brokerage firms are reported through the OTC Link® Alternative Trading System (ATS) maintained by a subsidiary of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. However, trading in our stock is sporadic. A public trading market for a particular class of stock having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of numerous buyers and sellers of that stock at any given time, which in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which issuers have no control. The trading market in our stock does not exhibit these characteristics. The trading history of our common stock has been characterized by relatively low trading volume. This lack of an active public market means that the value of a shareholder’s investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden and exaggerated fluctuations, as individual trades have a greater effect on our reported trading price than would be the case in a broad public market with significant daily trading volume.
The market price of our common stock may also be subject to fluctuations in response to numerous other factors, including the other factors discussed in this report, regardless of our actual operating performance. The possibility of such fluctuations occurring is increased due to the illiquid nature of the trading market in our common stock. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to sell our common stock at or above the price at which it was purchased, or at or above the current market price or at the time of his or her choosing. This illiquid trading market also makes it particularly difficult for a shareholder to dispose of a large number of shares of our stock at desired pricing or on a desired timetable.
Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock.
Shares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our common stock ranks junior to all our customer deposits and other indebtedness, including our subordinated debentures, whether now existing or hereafter incurred, and other non-equity claims on us, with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. In addition, our common stock is junior in priority, including with respect to dividend and liquidation rights, to our outstanding shares of Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. Further, the common stock will be subject to the prior liquidation rights of the holders of any debt we may issue in the future and may be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or other deposit accounts or obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the DIF or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.
Our organizational documents may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us.
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Association and By-Laws contain provisions, including a staggered board of directors and a supermajority vote requirement for certain acquisition transactions and other matters, that make it more difficult for a third party to gain control or acquire us without the consent of the board of directors. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for dissident shareholders to elect representatives as directors and take other corporate actions. To the extent that these provisions make these actions more difficult and make us a less attractive takeover candidate, they may not always be in our best interests or in the best interests of our shareholders, and in some circumstances may prevent holders of our common stock from receiving a takeover premium.
GENERAL RISKS
Market changes in delivery of financial services may adversely affect demand for our services.
Channels for delivering financial products and services to our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities and more use of online and mobile banking. We compete with larger providers that have significant resources to dedicate to improved technology and delivery channels. We periodically evaluate the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities to improve efficiencies. However, identification and closure of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.
Substantial competition could adversely affect us.
Banking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in northeastern and central Vermont. Our competitors include a number of state and national banks and tax-advantaged credit unions, as well as financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those that we offer. Some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions. Our large bank competitors, in particular, have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources that are well in excess of ours. These larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost and have a higher per-borrower lending limit than our Company, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with them effectively.
In addition, technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically, without the need for a physical presence in a market area. We are therefore likely to face increasing competition from out-of-market competitors, including national firms. Moreover, in many cases transactions may now be completed without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the Internet and by telephone without banks. Many non-bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints. If consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions, we could potentially lose fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits.
New products and services are essential to remain competitive but may subject us to additional risks.
We consistently attempt to offer new products and services to our customers to remain competitive. There can be risks and uncertainties associated with these new products and services especially if they are dependent on new technologies. We may spend significant time and resources in development of new products and services to market to customers. Through our development and implementation process we may incur risks associated with delivery timetables, pricing and profitability, compliance with regulations, technology failures and shifting customer preferences. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material effect on our financial condition, result of operations and business.
Changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.
Our future effective tax rates and tax liabilities could be unfavorably affected by increases in applicable tax rates and by other changes in federal or state tax laws, regulations and agency interpretations. Our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by the outcomes of any examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS or our state income, franchise, sales and use or other tax returns by the Vermont Department of Taxes. Our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected in the short-term by decreases in applicable tax rates that require us to revalue our deferred tax asset, as occurred in 2017 as a result of passage of the 2017 Tax Act.
Our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled personnel.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including executives. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense and our geographic market area might not be favorably perceived by potential executive management candidates. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key personnel.
We are not able to offer all of the financial services and products of a financial holding company.
Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can now combine under a “financial holding company” umbrella. Financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Some of our competitors have elected to become financial holding companies. We offer only traditional banking products and, trust and investment management services indirectly through, our affiliate, CFSG.

931059_2020.htm,931059,2020,"Item 1. Business
Rennova Health, Inc. (“Rennova,” the “Company,” “we”, or “it”) is a provider of healthcare services for our patients. The Company’s business originally focused on diagnostics and healthcare software development. In late 2016, the Company decided to pursue the opportunity to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals and is currently focused on implementing this business model. The Company now owns one operating hospital, a hospital that it plans to reopen and operate, a physician’s office in Tennessee and a rural clinic in Kentucky. As the business focus has transitioned to rural hospital operations, the Company has been working to separate its software entities into its own public company and plans to sell its last clinical laboratory outside of its hospital labs, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., and as a result the software entities’ and EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s operations now consist of only one business segment, Hospital Operations.
Hospital Operations
We believe that the acquisition or development of rural hospitals is a viable business strategy and will create a stable revenue base from provision of a needed service in rural America. Rural hospitals deliver a needed health care service and employment to communities that would otherwise have to travel an hour or more to alternative locations.
Our hospital operations began on August 8, 2017, following the receipt of the required licenses and regulatory approvals to open our first hospital in Oneida, Tennessee. They generated net revenues of approximately $7.2 million and approximately $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, based on our revenue collection history achieved, management recognized an approximately 14% and 14% hospital collection rate against gross billing, respectively.
Scott County Community Hospital (DBA Big South Fork Medical Center)
On January 13, 2017, we closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to Scott County Community Hospital, based in Oneida, Tennessee (the “Oneida Assets”). The Oneida Assets include a 52,000 square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. Scott County Community Hospital closed in July 2016 in connection with the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Pioneer Health Services, Inc. We acquired the Oneida Assets out of bankruptcy for a purchase price of $1.0 million. The hospital, which has been renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, became operational on August 8, 2017.
Jamestown Regional Medical Center
On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jamestown, Tennessee, referred to as Jamestown Regional Medical Center. The purchase was completed on June 1, 2018. The hospital operations were acquired by a newly-formed subsidiary, Jamestown TN Medical Center, Inc., and the hospital is an 85-bed facility of approximately 90,000 square feet on over eight acres of land, which offers a 24-hour Emergency Department with two spacious trauma bays and seven private exam rooms, inpatient and outpatient medical services and a Progressive Care Unit which provides telemetry services. The acquisition also included a separate physician practice known as Mountain View Physician Practice, Inc. Jamestown is located 38 miles west of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The Company suspended operations at the hospital in June 2019, as a result of the termination of its Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed but is expected to be initiated in mid-2021.
Jellico Medical Center
On March 5, 2019, the Company closed an asset purchase agreement whereby it acquired certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jellico, Tennessee known as Jellico Community Hospital and an outpatient clinic located in Williamsburg, Kentucky known as CarePlus Center. The hospital and the clinic and their associated assets were acquired from Jellico Community Hospital, Inc. and CarePlus Rural Health Clinic, LLC, respectively.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future. Jellico Community Hospital was a 54-bed acute care facility that offered comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. Jellico is located 33 miles east of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The CarePlus rural clinic in Kentucky offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis.
The purchase price was $658,537. This purchase price was made available by Christopher Diamantis, a former member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Diligence, legal and other costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $250,000, meaning the total cost of acquisition to the Company was approximately $908,000.
At March 31, 2021, the Company owns one operating hospital in Oneida, Tennessee, a rural clinic in Williamsburg, Kentucky and a closed hospital facility and doctors’ practice in Jamestown, Tennessee which it plans to reopen. The Company continues to expand its centralized hospital division management team in Knoxville, Tennessee and plans to secure adequate capital to stabilize and improve its management team and operations throughout 2021. The Company remains confident that its strategy to own and operate a number of rural hospitals in a close geographic location is a viable business strategy.
Discontinued Operations
Advanced Molecular Services and Health Technology Solutions, Inc.
On July 12, 2017, we announced plans to spin off our Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and in the third quarter of 2017 our Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. On June 10, 2020, the Company signed an agreement for the separation of these entities into a public company. The agreement with TPT Global Tech, Inc. (“TPT”) (OTC: TPTW), a California-based public company, was to merge HTS and AMSG into a public company after TPT completed a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary, InnovaQor, Inc., with this public company. Rennova terminated its agreement with TPT on March 8, 2021 after numerous attempts to close the transaction as proposed failed due to uncertainty and last minute unviable demands from TPT that would have created a high risk to the future success of the project. Rennova is currently considering the actions of TPT with the belief that TPT acted outside of agreements that were in place and may have converted Rennova owned confidential information for their own benefit and business strategy. Rennova intends to pursue any remedy available to it under the law to recover money owed from TPT and to protect its technology and assets.
The Company continues to pursue options available to separate these entities and believes this can be accomplished in the second quarter of 2021. The strategic goal of this transaction is to create a separate public company which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans and create value for Rennova and its shareholders. The Company has reflected the amounts relating to AMSG and HTS (referred to as the AMSG & HTS Group) as deposal groups classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Clinical Diagnostics
Prior to our focus on hospital operations, our principal focus had been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. This sector had been fraught with difficulties over the past number of years as payers reduced reimbursement and coverage for diagnostics in this sector. The lack of consistency between payer’s policies and their requirement for proof of medical necessity created uncertainty for ordering physicians and testing laboratories and their ability to receive payment. During 2018, we reduced the number of laboratories we operated to one facility operated by EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. in Palm Beach County, Florida. During the third quarter of 2020, we announced that we had reached a tentative agreement to sell EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., to TPT and as a result EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements. This proposed sale was terminated by Rennova on March 10, 2021, along with a lab management agreement and other permissions that had been granted by Rennova to TPT. Rennova is owed certain payments under the agreements and intends to take the necessary actions to secure payments owed by TPT.
History and Development of the Company
Rennova Health, Inc. is the result of a merger between two public companies, Medytox Solutions, Inc. and CollabRx, Inc., in November 2015.
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical diagnostics service and healthcare software sector between 2011 and 2014.
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
Recent and Other Developments
Reverse Stock Split
On July 30, 2020, the Company filed an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation in order to effect a 1-for-10,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock effective on July 31, 2020. On May 7, 2020, the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the Company’s securities approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of all of the Company’s shares of common stock at a specific ratio within a range from 1-for-100 to 1-for-10,000, and granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio and timing of the reverse split on or prior to December 31, 2020. The Board approved the specific ratio and timing on July 22, 2020.
As a result of the reverse stock split, every 10,000 shares of the Company’s pre-reverse split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of the Company’s common stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the reverse stock split, other than as a result of the cash payment for any fractional shares that would have otherwise been issued. Stockholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of common stock received a cash payment in respect of such fraction of a share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split.
The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 31, 2020 and the Company’s common stock continued to trade on a post-split basis at the open of business on August 3, 2020. The Company’s post-reverse split common stock has a new CUSIP number, but the par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the reverse stock split, except that, for the first 20 days after the reverse split, the common stock traded under the symbol “RNVAD”. It currently trades under our existing symbol “RNVA”. Prior to the reverse split, the Company had approximately 9.9 billion shares of common stock outstanding, which resulted in approximately 990,000 post-split shares.
All outstanding preferred shares, stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans immediately prior to the reverse stock split have generally been appropriately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred shares, stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans were exercisable or convertible by 10,000 and multiplying the exercise or conversion price by 10,000, as a result of the reverse stock split.
Voting Agreement
On August 13, 2020, Christopher Diamantis, a former member of the Company’s Board of Directors, entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy (the “Voting Agreement”) with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series M Preferred Stock”) held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. This means that the holders of Series M Preferred Stock have sufficient votes, by themselves, to approve or defeat any proposal voted on by the Company’s stockholders, unless there is a supermajority required under applicable law or by agreement.
Exchange of Debentures and Preferred Stock
On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Exchange, Redemption and Forbearance Agreement (the “Exchange and Redemption Agreement”) with certain institutional investors in the Company. In the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, the investors agreed to reduce their holdings of the Company’s debentures by approximately $19.3 million (including accrued interest and penalties) by exchanging the debentures and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series I-1Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series I-1 Preferred Stock”) and Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series I-2 Preferred Stock”) for 30,435 shares of the Company’s newly-authorized Series N Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series N Preferred Stock”). The terms of the Series N Preferred Stock are set forth in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Mr. Diamantis is also a party to the Exchange and Redemption Agreement as he continues to be a guarantor of a portion of the remaining debt.
The investors continued to own, after the initial exchange, approximately $14.9 million (including accrued interest and penalties) of debentures, but agreed that the Company could redeem $10 million of its obligations under these debentures held by the investors at face value, plus accrued interest and penalties. These debentures include approximately $5.0 million under debentures that have been guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis. This redemption right was exercisable for 90 days after August 31, 2020. If it had been exercised in full, the remaining debentures held by the investors (totaling approximately $4.9 million, including accrued interest and penalties) would have been exchanged for approximately 4,900 additional shares of Series N Preferred Stock.
During the 90-day redemption period (or until the occurrence of certain specified events, if earlier), the investors agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies against the Company or Mr. Diamantis as a result of any existing defaults under the outstanding securities. During that period, additional interest and penalties did not accrue and would have been forgiven if the redemption right was exercised in full. The redemption right was not exercised and all such additional amounts have become due and payable. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement is more fully discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Financial Results
Our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.6 million, as compared to a loss of $46.6 million for the same period of a year ago. The improvement was primarily due to other income (expense), net of approximately $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other income (expense), net of ($9.3) million in 2019, a $0.7 million net gain from legal settlements and a $2.0 million gain from the extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in interest expense of $11.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and a $1.3 million income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting the improvement in our net loss was an increase in the loss from continuing operations before other income (expense) and income taxes of $1.5 million.
Outlook
We believe that the transition of our business model from diagnostics is now complete and once stabilized will create more predictable and stable revenue. Rural hospitals provide a much-needed service to their local communities and reduce our reliance on commission-based sales employees to generate sales. We currently operate one hospital and a rural clinic in the same general geographic location and we own another hospital and physicians’ office at which operations are currently suspended. Owning a number of facilities in the same geographic location will create numerous efficiencies in purchasing and staffing and will enable the provision of additional, specialized and more valuable services that are needed by rural communities but cannot be sustained by a standalone rural hospital. We remain confident that this is a sustainable model we can continue to grow through acquisition and development and believe that we can benefit from the compliance and IT and software capabilities we already have in place. The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is more fully discussed below, has severely affected our operations and may cause such expectations not to be achieved or, even if achieved, not to be done in the expected timeframe.
Impact of the Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and we have taken steps intended to minimize the risk to our employees and patients. These steps have increased our costs and our revenues have been significantly adversely affected. Demand for hospital services has substantially decreased. As noted in Notes 1 and 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans (“PPP Notes”) as well as Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Provider Relief Funds from the federal government. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a further extended period, we expect to incur significant losses and additional financial assistance may be required. Going forward, we are unable to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business. The nature and effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our balance sheet and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic in our service areas; government activities to mitigate the pandemic’s effect; regulatory changes in response to the pandemic, especially those affecting rural hospitals; and existing and potential government assistance that may be provided.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governments to seek to reduce its spread have severely impacted the economy and the health care industry in particular. Hospitals have especially been affected. Small rural hospitals, such as ours, may be overwhelmed by patients if conditions worsen in their local areas. Staffing costs, and concerns due to the potential exposure to infections, may increase, as may the costs of needed medical supplies necessary to keep the hospitals open. Doctors and patients may defer elective procedures and other health care services. Travel bans, social distancing and quarantines may limit access to our facilities. Business closings and layoffs in our local areas may result in the loss of insurance and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered.
Hospitalizations in Tennessee for COVID-19 increased throughout 2020 and appear to have peaked in December 2020. From third-party information there have been 822,085 cases and 12,001 deaths as of April 12, 2021. The roll out of vaccinations is expected to significantly reduce the risk of death and reduce transmission of the virus and a return to more normal expectations is expected throughout 2021. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company and the operations of our hospitals. Our plans to reopen our Jamestown Regional Medical Center, whose operations were suspended in June 2019, have been disrupted by the pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed.
On September 14, 2020, the Company announced that it had purchased and taken delivery of equipment to provide rapid testing for COVID-19 at Jellico Community Hospital, CarePlus Center and Big South Fork Medical Center in an effort to provide the Company with an additional revenue stream. On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future.
Competition
The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The most significant competition our hospitals, and any other hospitals we may acquire, face comes from hospitals that provide more complex services, and other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that also compete for patients. Our hospitals, our competitors, and other healthcare industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position. In addition, increasing consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms and otherwise affect our competitive position.
Governmental Regulation
Overview
The healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and there continue to be federal and state proposals that would, and actions that do, impose limitations on government and private payments to providers. In addition, there regularly are proposals to increase co-payments and deductibles from program and private patients. Facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay. Such controls include what is commonly referred to as “utilization review”. Utilization review entails the review of a patient’s admission and course of treatment by a third party. Historically, utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed. Utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by Medicare and Medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements.
Many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, additional measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Various states have applied, or are considering applying, for a waiver from current Medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers. These proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured, and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals, physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under Medicaid.
Healthcare Facility Regulation
Certificate of Need Requirements
A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare services. Certificates of Need (“CONs”), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. Tennessee, the state in which we currently own our hospitals, has a CON law that applies to such facilities. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations. Any violation of state CON laws can result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. We are unable to predict whether our hospitals will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. In addition, future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require CONs.
Future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require CONs or which have less stringent CON requirements than the state in which Rennova currently owns hospitals. Any healthcare facility operated by the Company in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors, including physicians.
Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance
Healthcare facilities are subject to, and are required to comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility’s local governing board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that we comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) will implement new requirements in the future and whether we will be able to comply with any new requirements.
General Healthcare Regulations
Drugs and Controlled Substances
Various licenses and permits are required by our hospitals to dispense narcotics. They are required to register our dispensing operations for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with certain operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state health departments and other state agencies.
Fraud and Abuse, Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Regulations
Participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing our businesses, our participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs if it:
● makes claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments;
● pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program;
● fails to report or repay improper or excess payments; or
● fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital’s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients.
Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the federal Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) and other governmental fraud and abuse programs and the OIG has issued and periodically updated compliance program guidance for hospitals. Each federal fiscal year, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse.
Sections of the Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “anti-kickback” statute, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare or other healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by Medicare or other government programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. HHS has issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti-kickback statute. A given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal; however, business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program. HIPAA created civil penalties for proscribed conduct, including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services. These laws cover all health insurance programs, private as well as governmental. In addition, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, such as the anti-kickback statute, to include not just Medicare and Medicaid services, but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Finally, HIPAA established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. These mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies, as well as a whistleblower program, where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower. HIPAA also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
There is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities, the OIG, the courts and the U.S. Congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient-care referrals and opportunities. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction and to reinterpret the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. Enforcement actions have increased, as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities.
In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements. Certain exceptions are available for employment agreements, leases, physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements. A person making a referral, or seeking payment for services referred, in violation of the Stark Act is subject to civil monetary penalties; restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims; and/or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare program, which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs.
Further, if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity, and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity, then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty. Compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing. For example, CMS has issued a “self-referral disclosure protocol” for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. In light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential liabilities under the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the Stark Act to CMS. It is likely that self-disclosure of Stark Act violations will increase in the future. Finally, many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care.
The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly, and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the “knowing” submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the False Claims Act. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of “whistleblower” lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation. If a provider is found to be liable under the False Claims Act, the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties for each separate false claim. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality.
HIPAA Transaction, Privacy and Security Requirements
HIPAA and federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA contain, among other measures, provisions that have required the Company to implement modified or new computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. The federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry, provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information.
A violation of the HIPAA regulations could result in civil money penalties per standard violated. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information, up to five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Since there is limited history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time, it is difficult to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the HIPAA regulations or the potential for fines and penalties, which may result from any violation of the regulations.
HIPAA Privacy Regulations
HIPAA privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The regulations provide increased patient control over medical records, mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient’s right to privacy and, with a few exceptions, require that an individual’s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare-related purposes. These privacy standards apply to all health plans, all healthcare clearinghouses and all healthcare providers, such as our hospitals, that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions, and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our hospitals and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information, and they require our facilities to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf. In addition, our hospitals are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties.
The HIPAA privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. We believe all of our facilities are in compliance with current HIPAA privacy regulations.
HIPAA Electronic Data Standards
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange. These provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Among other things, these provisions require us to use standard data formats and code sets established by HHS when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions, including health claims and equivalent encounter information, healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status.
The HHS regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions. The uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function. We believe that our management information systems comply with HIPAA’s electronic data regulations and standards.
HIPAA Security Standards
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information. The HIPAA security standards rule specifies a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. The standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications. We believe we are in compliance with all the aspects of the HIPAA security regulations.
HIPAA National Provider Identifier
HIPAA also required HHS to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals, employers, health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions. All healthcare providers, including our hospitals, were required to obtain a new National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by May 23, 2007. Our hospitals implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number. HHS has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals. Once these regulations are issued in final form, we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant, but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time. We cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers. HHS is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans; however, there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules. The issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely.
Medical Waste Regulations
Our operations, especially our hospitals, generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Based on our current level of operations, we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
Compliance Program
The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its operations. The health care industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusions from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, necessary to operate as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Professional Liability
As part of our business, our hospitals are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations. To cover a portion of these claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts which are commercially available and believed to be sufficient for operations as currently conducted, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect.
Environmental Regulation
We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. To date, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. Similarly, we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations.
Payment for Services
In each of 2020 and 2019, the Company’s Hospital Operations derived over 42% and 56% of their net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company’s Hospital Operations depend significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for services.
Following an inspection at Jamestown Regional Medical Center on February 5, 2019, the hospital was informed on February 15 that several conditions of participation in its Medicare agreement were deficient. The hospital was informed that if the deficiencies were not corrected by May 16 the Medicare agreement would terminate. A follow-up inspection on May 15 resulted in the determination that the hospital had failed to adequately correct the deficiencies highlighted and a notice of involuntary termination was issued that was effective on June 12, 2019. A significant percentage of patients at Jamestown Regional Medical Center are covered by Medicare and without any ability to get paid for these services the Company suspended operations at the hospital. On June 10, 2019 the Company hired a new CEO to oversee the reopening of the hospital and took steps to re-enter the Medicare program. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening has also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed.
Further healthcare reform could occur in 2021, including changes to the Affordable Care Act and Medicare reform, initiatives to address surprise billing and increased price transparency, as well as administrative requirements that may affect coverage, reimbursement and utilization of our hospitals and laboratory in ways that are currently unpredictable.
Employees
As of March 15, 2021, we have 93 employees for our continuing operations, of which 63 are full time. Of our total employees from continuing operations, 3 are assigned to corporate administration and 90 are assigned to our Hospital Operations. In addition, we have 91 employees associated with our discontinued operations, including 86 that were still employed on March 15, 2021 and that were associated with Jellico Community Hospital, which was closed on March 1, 2021. We continue to adjust our number of employees to achieve efficiencies and cost savings where applicable.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on a regular basis and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. All reports of the Company filed with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC’s Web site at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials filed by the Company at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may also obtain additional information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our securities is highly speculative and subject to numerous and substantial risks. These risks include those set forth herein. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report before you decide to invest in our securities. If any of the following events actually occur, our business could be materially harmed. In such case, the value of your investment may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should not invest in our securities unless you can afford the loss of your entire investment.
The Company’s Tennessee operations have operated at a loss and with a cash deficiency. The Company has limited access to capital and is solely dependent on its ability to secure the funding required to cover current losses and execute on its business plan until cash flow break even.
Cash deficiencies mean that payroll has been late, making retention of key employees difficult. Unless this situation is corrected we may lose employees to the point where it becomes difficult to operate, or we may fail to attract employees to key positions necessary for the business to succeed.
Losses incurred to date have created a need for additional capital, often at short notice required for the Company to remain in business. The Company relies on its CEO to secure funding to meet cash shortfalls. If capital is not secured, it will be difficult for the Company to remain in operation.
The holders of our Series M Convertible Preferred Stock have, in the aggregate, votes equal to 51% of all of the Company’s voting securities.
Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. This means that the holders of Series M Preferred Stock have sufficient votes, by themselves, to approve or defeat any proposal voted on by the Company’s stockholders, unless there is a supermajority required under applicable law or by agreement. Holders of our common stock, therefore, will not have any control on issues submitted to a vote of stockholders.
Mr. Diamantis owns all of the outstanding Series M Preferred Stock. On August 13, 2020, however, he granted an irrevocable proxy to vote the Series M Preferred Stock to Seamus Lagan, the Chief Executive Officer, President and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company. As a result, Mr. Lagan controls a majority of the voting securities of the Company.
The current and potential effects of the coronavirus pandemic have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Demand for services at our hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially decreased, resulting in materially lower revenues. If the pandemic continues for a further extended period, we expect to incur additional significant losses and additional financial assistance may be required. Hospitalizations in Tennessee for COVID-19 have been increasing. In particular, infection levels in each of the three counties in which the Company owns hospitals are at the highest levels to date. An availability of vaccines may lessen the impact of the virus but no assurance can be given as to the timing of that occurring in our service area.
The coronavirus pandemic and the steps taken by governments to seek to reduce its spread have severely impacted the economy and the health care industry in particular. Hospitals have especially been affected. Small rural hospitals, such as ours, may be overwhelmed by patients if conditions worsen in their local areas. Staffing costs, and concerns due to the potential exposure to infections, may increase, as may the costs of needed medical supplies necessary to keep the hospitals open. Doctors and patients may defer elective procedures and other health care services. Travel bans, social distancing and quarantines may limit access to our facilities. Business closings and layoffs in our local areas may result in the loss of insurance and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered.
Although our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we have recently accumulated significant losses and have negative cash flows from operations that could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or raise additional capital to fund our operations or limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry. Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us. These or additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
If we are unable to improve our liquidity position we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business, which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.
We have accumulated significant losses and have negative cash flows from operations, and at December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit of $56.5 million and $868.5 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we used cash of $16.8 million to fund our operations during 2020. Our cash position is critically deficient, and payments for our operations are not being made in the ordinary course of business. The continued losses and other related factors, including the payment defaults of outstanding debentures and notes payable, as more fully discussed in Notes 1, 8 and 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-20, and having met the criteria for “held for sale”, we have reflected amounts relating to AMSG and HTS as disposal groups classified as held for sale and included as part of discontinued operations. The discontinued operations of AMSG and HTS are described further in Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
On June 10, 2020, the Company signed an agreement for the separation of AMSG & HTS into a public company. The agreement with TPT Global Tech, Inc. (“TPT”) (OTC: TPTW), a California-based public company, was to merge HTS and AMSG into a public company after TPT completed a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary, InnovaQor, Inc., with this public company. Rennova terminated its agreement with TPT on March 8, 2021 after numerous attempts to close the transaction as proposed failed due to uncertainty and last minute unviable demands from TPT that would have created a high risk to the future success of the project. Rennova is currently considering the actions of TPT with the belief that TPT acted outside of agreements that were in place and may have converted Rennova owned confidential information for their own benefit and business strategy. Rennova intends to pursue any remedy available to it under the law to recover money owed from TPT and to protect its technology and assets.
The Company continues to pursue options available to it to separate these entities and believes this can be accomplished in the second quarter of 2021. The strategic goal of this transaction is to create a separate public company which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans and create value for Rennova and its shareholders.
In addition, during 2020, the Company announced that it had reached a tentative agreement to sell its last clinical laboratory outside of its hospitals, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., to TPT and as a result, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. This proposed sale was terminated by Rennova on March 10, 2021, along with a lab management agreement and other permissions that had been granted by Rennova to TPT. Rennova is owed certain payments under the agreements and intends to take the necessary actions to secure payments owed by TPT.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our hospital operations provided services to 17,316 and 41,677 patients and recognized approximately $7.2 million and $15.9 million of net revenues, respectively, and recorded approximately $59.8 million and $123.8 million of gross revenues during 2020 and 2019, respectively. On March 5, 2019, we acquired certain assets of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. On August 15, 2019, the Company received notice from CMS that the change of ownership for Jellico was effective from March 1, 2019, enabling the hospital, after almost six months of ownership, to bill and get paid for services beginning on March 1, 2019.
The Company’s core business plan is to own and operate rural hospitals, which is a specialized marketplace with a requirement for capable and knowledgeable management. The Company’s current financial condition may make it difficult to attract and maintain adequate expertise in its management team to successfully operate the Company’s hospitals. To date, the Company has not realized profitable hospital operations.
Following an inspection at Jamestown Regional Medical Center on February 5, 2019, the hospital was informed on February 15 that several conditions of participation in the CMS-approved Medicare accreditation program were deficient. The hospital was informed that if the deficiencies were not corrected by May 16 the Medicare agreement would terminate. A follow-up inspection on May 15 resulted in the determination that the hospital had failed to adequately correct the deficiencies highlighted and a notice of involuntary termination was issued effective on June 12, 2019. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed but is expected to be initiated in mid-2021.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the Company’s business plan or strategy.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan, which is to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals, raise any additional capital or secure the additional financing necessary to implement our current operating plan. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise adequate capital to fund our operations and repay our outstanding debentures and other past due obligations, fully align our operating costs, increase our revenues and eventually regain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
Our acquisitions to date do not provide assurance that the acquired operations will be accretive to our earnings or otherwise improve our results of operations.
Acquisitions, such as those completed and planned involve the integration of previously separate businesses into a common enterprise in which it is envisioned that synergistic operations will result in improved financial performance. However, realization of these envisioned results is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:
● Diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;
● Difficulties integrating the acquired business, technologies and personnel into our business;
● Potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of the acquired business; and
● Exposure to unforeseen liabilities of the acquired business
There is no assurance that the acquisitions of the Big South Fork Medical Center, Jamestown Regional Medical Center or CarePlus Center will be accretive to our earnings or otherwise improve our results of operations. The Company suspended operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2019, as a result of the termination of its Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed and is now intended for mid-2021.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the current position of the business or the longer-term business strategy.
We have decided to alter our business model to focus on hospital acquisition and development which may not succeed if we are unable to effectively compete for patients. Local residents could use other hospitals and healthcare providers.
The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The most significant competition our hospitals face comes from hospitals that provide more complex services as well as other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that also compete for patients. Our hospitals, our competitors, and other healthcare industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in accountable care organizations (ACOs) or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position. In addition, increasing consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms and otherwise affect our competitive position.
We expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively with other hospitals and other healthcare providers, local residents may seek healthcare services at providers other than our hospitals and affiliated businesses.
Our results of operations may be adversely affected if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) is repealed, replaced or otherwise changed.
The ACA has increased the number of people with health care insurance. It also has reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Numerous proposals continue to be discussed to repeal, amend or replace the law. We cannot predict whether any such repeal, amend or replace proposals, or any parts of them, will become law and, if they do, what their substance or timing will be. There is uncertainty whether, when and how the ACA may be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of any alternative provisions and the impact of any alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. Efforts to repeal or change the ACA or implement other initiatives intended to reform healthcare delivery and financial systems may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The industry trend towards value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward “value-based” purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require providers under such programs to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payors currently require providers under such programs to report quality data and several commercial payors do not reimburse providers under such programs for certain preventable adverse events.
We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.
General economic conditions.
Much healthcare spending is discretionary and can be significantly impacted by economic downturns. When patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions, they may choose to defer or forego elective surgeries and other non-emergent procedures, which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals. In addition, employers may impose or patients may select a high-deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all, which increases a hospital’s dependence on self-pay revenue. Moreover, a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms.
We are unable to quantify the specific impact of current or recent economic conditions on our business, however, we believe that the economic conditions in the service areas in which our hospitals operate may have an adverse impact on our operations. Such impact can be expected to continue to affect not only the healthcare decisions of our patients and potential patients but could also have an adverse impact on the solvency of certain managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us.
Healthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services.
We also face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including healthcare plans, to reduce utilization and reimbursement for healthcare services.
The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans and payers, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers. These healthcare plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing services to their members through capped payment arrangements. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.
The increased consolidation among healthcare plans and payers increases the potential adverse impact of not being, or ceasing to be, a contracted provider with any such insurer. The ACA includes provisions, including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, which may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.
We expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of services. These efforts, including future changes in third-party payer rules, practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to many healthcare plans, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Unless we raise sufficient funds, we will not be able to succeed in our business model.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have relied on issuances of equity, debentures and notes payable, loans from a former member of our Board of Directors and the sale of accounts receivable under sales agreements to fund our operations. We generated negative cash flow from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. If this trend were to continue and we are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations through other sources, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern (see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, to fund our operations under our current business model.
Some of our operations are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting “kickbacks” and other laws designed to prohibit payments for referrals and eliminate healthcare fraud.
Federal and state anti-kickback and similar laws prohibit payment, or offers of payment, in exchange for referrals of products and services for which reimbursement may be made by Medicare or other federal and state healthcare programs. Some state laws contain similar prohibitions that apply without regard to the payer of reimbursement for the services. Under a federal statute, known as the “Stark Law” or “self-referral” prohibition, physicians, subject to certain exceptions, are prohibited from referring their Medicare or Medicaid program patients to providers with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship, and the providers are prohibited from billing for services rendered in violation of Stark Law referral prohibitions. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and Stark Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. States may impose similar penalties. The ACA significantly strengthened provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Law provisions, and other health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by private citizen “relators” for perceived violations of these laws. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen relators under federal or state false claims laws.
Federal officials responsible for administering and enforcing the healthcare laws and regulations have made a priority of eliminating healthcare fraud. For example, the ACA includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increased potential penalties for violations. Federal funding available for combating health care fraud and abuse generally has increased. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, many of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly those relating to billing and reimbursement of services and those relating to relationships with physicians, hospitals and patients, contain language that has not been interpreted by courts. We must rely on our interpretation of these laws and regulations based on the advice of our counsel and regulatory or law enforcement authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations and may seek to enforce legal remedies or penalties against us for violations.
From time to time we may need to change our operations, particularly pricing or billing practices, in response to changing interpretations of these laws and regulations, or regulatory or judicial determinations with respect to these laws and regulations. These occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and harm important business relationships that we have with healthcare providers, payers and others. Furthermore, if a regulatory or judicial authority finds that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations, we would be required to refund amounts that were billed and collected in violation of such laws and regulations. In addition, we may voluntarily refund amounts that were alleged to have been billed and collected in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In either case, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition.
Moreover, regardless of the outcome, if we or physicians or other third parties with whom we do business are investigated by a regulatory or law enforcement authority we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and our management may be required to divert a substantial amount of time to an investigation.
To enhance compliance with applicable health care laws, and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities, such as the OIG, have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual, and for many years the OIG has made available a model compliance program. In addition, certain states require that health care providers that engage in substantial business under the state Medicaid program have a compliance program that generally adheres to the standards set forth in the Model Compliance Program. Also, under the ACA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will require suppliers, such as the Company, to adopt, as a condition of Medicare participation, compliance programs that meet a core set of requirements. While we have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, healthcare compliance and ethics programs that generally incorporate the OIG’s recommendations, and training our applicable employees in such compliance, having such a program can be no assurance that we will avoid any compliance issues.
We conduct our business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could, directly or indirectly, harm our operating results and financial condition.
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. Areas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business include, without limitation:
● federal and state laws applicable to billing and claims payment;
● federal and state laws relating to licensure;
● federal and state anti-kickback laws;
● federal and state false claims laws;
● federal and state self-referral and financial inducement laws, including the federal physician anti-self-referral law, or the Stark Law;
● coverage and reimbursement levels by Medicare and other governmental payors and private insurers;
● HIPAA, along with the revisions to HIPAA as a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and analogous state laws;
● federal and state regulation of privacy, security, electronic transactions and identity theft;
● federal, state and local laws governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical and hazardous waste;
● Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules and regulations;
● changes to laws, regulations and rules as a result of the ACA; and
● changes to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including tax laws.
These laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws or regulations, could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, a significant change in any of these laws or regulations may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws or regulations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.
Failure to comply with complex federal and state laws and regulations related to submission of claims for services can result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
We are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the submission of claims for payment for services, including those that relate to coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental health care programs, the amounts that may be billed for our services and to whom claims for services may be submitted.
Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or result in attempts by third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments from us that have already been made. Submission of claims in violation of certain statutory or regulatory requirements can result in penalties, including substantial civil money penalties for each item or service billed to Medicare in violation of the legal requirement, and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Government authorities may also assert that violations of laws and regulations related to submission or causing the submission of claims violate the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) or other laws related to fraud and abuse, including submission of claims for services that were not medically necessary. Violations of the FCA could result in enormous economic liability. The FCA provides that all damages are trebled. For example, we could be subject to FCA liability if it was determined that the services we provided were not medically necessary and not reimbursable, particularly if it were asserted that we contributed to the physician’s referrals of unnecessary services to us. It is also possible that the government could attempt to hold us liable under fraud and abuse laws for improper claims submitted by an entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement that resulted in submission of the improper claims.
Our hospitals are subject to potential claims for professional liability, including existing or potential claims based on the acts or omissions of third parties, which claims may not be covered by insurance.
Our hospitals are subject to potential claims for professional liability (medical malpractice) in connection with their operations, as well as potentially acquired or discontinued operations. To cover such claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts believed to be sufficient for operations, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect. The assertion of a significant number of claims, either within a self-insured retention (deductible) or individually or in the aggregate in excess of available insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Premiums for professional liability insurance have historically been volatile and we cannot assure you that professional liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The operations of hospitals also depend on the professional services of physicians and other trained healthcare providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations, including independent laboratories and physicians rendering diagnostic and medical services. There can be no assurance that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of healthcare services would not be brought against one of our hospitals, resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution from the third party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals. A shortage of qualified healthcare professionals could weaken our ability to deliver healthcare services.
Our hospitals’ operations are dependent on the efforts, ability and experience of healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians. Each hospital’s success has been, and will continue to be, influenced by its ability to attract and retain these skilled employees. A shortage of healthcare professionals, the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause the operating performance of one or more of our hospitals to decline.
A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on Medicare and Medicaid payments and possible reductions in Medicare or Medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues.
A significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Over 42% and 56% of consolidated net patient revenues were derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Previous legislative changes have resulted in, and future legislative changes may result in, limitations on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs.
Future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Billing for medical services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals and employer groups. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems.
Missing, incomplete, or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing or even having to pay back amounts incorrectly billed and collected could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in CMS and other government programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
There have been times when our accounts receivable have increased at a greater rate than revenue growth and, therefore, have adversely affected our cash flows from operations. We have taken steps to implement systems and processing changes intended to improve billing procedures and related collection results. However, we cannot assure that our ongoing assessment of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional provisions. Such additional provisions, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.
Our operations are always subject to adverse impacts resulting from extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek our services or in our employees’ ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to provide our services. The occurrence of any such event and/or a disruption of our operations as a result may adversely affect our results of operations.
Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.
We operate in a business that is characterized by intense competition. Our major competitors include large national hospitals that possess greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel than we do. Many of our competitors have long established relationships. Although our hospitals operate in communities where they are currently the only general acute care hospital, they face substantial competition from other hospitals. Although these competing hospitals may be many miles away, patients in these markets may migrate to these competing hospitals as a result of local physician referrals, managed care plan incentives or personal choices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the future.
The healthcare business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. Pricing of services is often one of the most significant factors used by patients, health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a provider. As a result of the healthcare industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger providers are able to increase cost efficiencies. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. We may also face competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. Additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.
Failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the Company’s reputation with patients, and cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation.
Pursuant to HIPAA and certain similar state laws, we must comply with comprehensive privacy and security standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information. Under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA, HIPAA was expanded to require certain data breach notifications, to extend certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly to business associates, to heighten penalties for noncompliance and to enhance enforcement efforts. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations relating to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions.
The Company receives certain personal and financial information about its patients. In addition, the Company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. While we take reasonable and prudent steps to protect this information, a compromise in the Company’s security systems that results in patient personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the Company’s failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the Company’s reputation with its customers and others, as well as the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. It could also result in litigation against the Company or the imposition of penalties.
Failure of the Company to comply with emerging electronic transmission standards could adversely affect our business.
The failure of our IT systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology (“HCIT”) standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information could require costly modifications to our existing HCIT systems. While we do not expect HCIT standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply, if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing HCIT standards, we could lose customers and business opportunities.
Compliance with the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the Company’s costs.
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:
● the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the Company’s services, and its healthcare operations activities;
● a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;
● the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information;
● administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and
● the protection of computing systems maintaining Electronic Personal Health Information (“ePHI”).
The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, the Company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the Company may also be required to comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict the Company’s ability to use or disclose patient identifiable data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Due to the enactment of HITECH and an increase in the amount of monetary financial penalties, government enforcement has also increased. It is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be, other than heightened scrutiny and emphasis on compliance. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to significant monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, the Company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information.
Health care reform and related programs (e.g. Health Insurance Exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues, profitability and cash flow.
Our services are billed to private patients, Medicare, Medicaid, commercial clients, managed care organizations (“MCOs”) and third-party insurance companies. Bills may be sent to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. Increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues.
A portion of the third-party insurance fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. As patient cost-sharing increases, collectability may be impacted.
In addition, Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. Measures to regulate health care delivery have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased utilization as well as increased complexity and new regulatory and administrative requirements. Changes to, or repeal of, the ACA, the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, also may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement and utilization of services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable.
The Company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. If the Company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing the number of patients treated and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues, profitability and cash flows.
As an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the Company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. These changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. Given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to or repeal of the ACA, the exact impact to employers including the Company is uncertain.
A failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business objectives and its net revenues and profitability.
Part of the Company’s strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the Company’s business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the Company’s capabilities and increase its presence in key geographic areas. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the Company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the Company’s operating results. Furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others:
● failure to obtain regulatory clearance;
● loss of key customers or employees;
● difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information, including lack of complete integration;
● unidentified regulatory problems;
● failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided;
● coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and
● diversion of management’s attention from the present core business of the Company.
The Company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the Company’s business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. Even if the Company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions.
Adverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business and financial condition.
The Company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability, contracts and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies and Medicare or Medicaid payors requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements, privacy practices and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial Federal and state government regulation and audit. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the Company’s reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business.
As a company with limited capital and human resources, we anticipate that more of management’s time and attention will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements than would be the case with a company that has well established controls and procedures. This diversion of management’s time and attention may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, or if we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal control over financial reporting when we are required to do so, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock, if any, and ability to obtain any necessary equity or debt financing could suffer. Presently, our auditors are not required to audit internal controls over financial reporting. However, if in the future such a requirement arises, and in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal control over financial reporting in connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures, we may be unable to file our periodic reports with the SEC. This would likely have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock, if any, and our ability to secure any necessary additional financing, and could result in the delisting of our common stock. In such event, the liquidity of our common stock would be severely limited and the market price of our common stock would likely decline significantly.
An inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company’s business.
The loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees by the Company could adversely affect the business. The success of the Company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team.
Failure in the Company’s information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of updates or enhancements to those systems could significantly delay billing and otherwise disrupt the Company’s operations or patient relationships.
The Company’s business and patient relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. Despite network security measures and other precautions, the Company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. Sustained system failures or interruption of the Company’s systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the Company’s ability to conduct its business. Breaches with respect to protected health information could result in violations of HIPAA and analogous state laws, and risk the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Failure of the Company’s information technology systems could adversely affect the Company’s business, profitability and financial condition.
Increasing health insurance premiums and co-payments or high deductible health plans may cause individuals to forgo health insurance and avoid medical attention, either of which may reduce demand for our products and services.
Health insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles have generally increased in recent years. These increases may cause individuals to forgo health insurance, as well as medical attention. This behavior may reduce demand for services at our hospitals.
Our business has substantial indebtedness.
We currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2020, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $19.6 million, the majority of which is short term past due. As a result of non-payment of past due debentures, notes payable, we have recorded penalties of approximately $6.9 million and penalty interest of approximately $7.9 million as of December 31, 2020.
Our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt, and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.
Failure to achieve and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may result in our not being able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
Our management has determined that as of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the results of our remediation efforts regarding our material weaknesses are not successful, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.
Hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement new systems or system enhancements to existing systems or cyber security breaches may harm the Company.
The Company’s success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. A failure of the network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, we currently do not have sufficient redundant facilities to provide IT capacity in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions the Company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at our computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to clients.
In addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the Company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. Such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to clients. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, and improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the Company’s reputation and harm the business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the Company has operations) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. Although the Company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur.
Provisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders may consider in their best interests, which could negatively affect our stock price.
Provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms to be fixed by our Board of Directors. Stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner. Issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us, and could effectively be used as an anti-takeover device.
Our bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors, and require that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president or the board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board.
The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
As a public company, we incur significant administrative workload and expenses.
As a public company, we must comply with various laws, regulations and requirements, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements, including our public company reporting requirements, continues to occupy a significant amount of the time of our Board of Directors and management and involves significant accounting, legal and other expenses. We will need to hire additional accounting personnel to handle these responsibilities, which will increase our operating costs. Furthermore, these laws, regulations and requirements could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as executive officers.
New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. We are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and certain of our financing agreements, while outstanding, prohibit us from declaring or paying cash dividends without approval which may not be granted. In addition, we anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
We may use our stock to pay, to a large extent, for future acquisitions or for the repayment of debt, which would be dilutive to investors.
We may choose to use additional stock to pay, to a large extent, for future acquisitions or for the repayment of debt, and believe that doing so will enable us to retain a greater percentage of our operating capital to pay for operations and marketing. Price and volume fluctuations in our stock might negatively impact our ability to effectively use our stock to pay for acquisitions, or could cause us to offer stock as consideration for acquisitions on terms that are not favorable to us and our stockholders. If we did resort to issuing stock in lieu of cash for acquisitions or the repayment of debt under unfavorable circumstances, it would result in increased dilution to investors.
The success of our hospitals depends upon their ability to maintain good relationships with physicians and, if a hospital is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians, admissions and outpatient revenues may decrease and operating performance could decline.
Because physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and outpatient services, a hospital’s success is, in part, dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs, the admissions and referrals practices of the physicians and the ability to maintain good relations with physicians. If one or more of our hospitals is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians, admissions may decrease and operating performance could decline.
Our hospital operations are dependent on the local economies and the surrounding areas in which they operate. A significant deterioration in those economies could cause a material adverse effect on our hospitals’ businesses.
Each rural hospital operations is dependent upon the local economy where it is located. A significant deterioration in that economy would negatively impact the demand for the hospital’s services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for service as rendered.
On June 1, 2018, we acquired certain assets related to our Jamestown Regional Medical Center. This hospital is 38 miles west of our Big South Fork Medical Center. On March 5, 2019, we acquired certain assets related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. Jellico Community Hospital was 33 miles east of our Big South Fork Medical Center and CarePlus is nearby in Kentucky. Although the Company believes the synergies of management and services in a close geographic location will create numerous efficiencies for the Company, it has exposed the Company to a much greater degree to the effects of the economy in that one area. The Company suspended operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2019, as a result of the termination of its Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed and is now intended for mid-2021.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building.
Our revenues are concentrated in Tennessee, which makes us particularly sensitive to changes in that state.
Our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in the State of Tennessee. Any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in the state could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid program or other health care laws or regulations in that state could also have an adverse effect.
Our common stock is subject to substantial dilution by exercises of warrants and conversions or exercises of other securities into common stock.
The Company has outstanding options, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures. Exercise of the options and warrants, and conversions of the convertible preferred stock and debentures could result in substantial dilution of our common stock and a decline in its market price. In addition, the terms of certain of the warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures issued by us provide for reductions in the per share exercise prices of the warrants and the per share conversion prices of the debentures and preferred stock (if applicable and subject to a floor in certain cases), in the event that we issue common stock or common stock equivalents (as that term is defined in the agreements) at an effective exercise/conversion price that is less than the then exercise/conversion prices of the outstanding warrants, preferred stock or debentures, as the case may be. These provisions, as well as the issuances of debentures and preferred stock with conversion prices that vary based upon the price of our common stock on the date of conversion, have resulted in significant dilution of our common stock and have given rise to reverse splits of our common stock.
The following table presents the dilutive effect of our various potential common shares as of December 31, 2020:
Continued conversions and exercises of the Company’s outstanding securities into common stock have further depressed the market price of our common stock and have caused corresponding decreases of the exercise and conversion prices of much of the remaining convertible securities due to their anti-dilution provisions. As of March 31, 2021, the total dilutive potential common shares, including outstanding common stock, was 25.9 billion shares.
The sale of a substantial amount of our common stock, including resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversions of preferred stock and convertible debentures and the exercise of the outstanding warrants in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.
Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market value of our other securities.
In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.

Item 3.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings related to contractual disputes, employment matters, regulatory and compliance matters, intellectual property rights and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry which may inherently lend itself to legal matters. Management is aware that litigation has associated costs and that results of adverse litigation verdicts could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company’s policy is to expense legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the legal proceedings in the period in which the expense is incurred. Management, in consultation with legal counsel, has addressed known assertions and predicted unasserted claims below.
Biohealth Medical Laboratory, Inc. and PB Laboratories, LLC (the “Companies”) filed suit against CIGNA Health in 2015 alleging that CIGNA failed to pay claims for laboratory services the Companies provided to patients pursuant to CIGNA - issued and CIGNA - administered plans. In 2016, the U.S. District Court dismissed part of the Companies’ claims for lack of standing. The Companies appealed that decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which in late 2017 reversed the District Court’s decision and found that the Companies have standing to raise claims arising out of traditional insurance plans as well as self-funded plans. In July 2019, the Companies and EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. filed suit against CIGNA Health for failure to pay claims for laboratory services provided. Cigna Health, in turn, sued for improper billing practices. CIGNA’s case against the Company was dismissed on June 22, 2020. The suit remains ongoing but because the Company did not have the financial resources to see the legal action to conclusion it assigned the benefit, if any, from the suit to Christopher Diamantis for his assumption of the costs to carry the cost to conclusion.
In November of 2016, the IRS commenced an audit of the Company’s 2015 Federal tax return. Based upon the audit results and additional carryback adjustments, the Company made provisions of approximately $1.0 million as a liability and approximately $0.9 million as a receivable in its financial statements. During 2020, the Company received $0.6 million of income tax refunds. During the first quarter of 2020, the U.S. Congress approved the CARES Act, which allows a five-year carryback privilege for federal net operating tax losses that arose in a tax year beginning in 2018 and through the current tax year, that is, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 million in refunds from the carryback of certain of its federal net operating losses. Income taxes are more fully discussed in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
On September 27, 2016, a tax warrant was issued against the Company by the Florida Department of Revenue (the “DOR”) for unpaid 2014 state income taxes in the approximate amount of $0.9 million, including penalties and interest. The Company entered into a Stipulation Agreement with the DOR allowing the Company to make monthly installments until July 2019. The Company has made payments to reduce the amount owed. The Company intends to renegotiate another Stipulation agreement. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful. The balance accrued of approximately $0.4 million remained outstanding to the DOR at December 31, 2020.
In December of 2016, TCS-Florida, L.P. (“Tetra”), filed suit against the Company for failure to make the required payment under an equipment leasing contract that the Company had with Tetra and received a judgment against the Company. In May 2018, Tetra and the Company agreed to dispose of certain equipment and the proceeds from the sale were applied to the outstanding balance. In July 2020, the Company entered into a settlement with Tetra and paid $100,000 as full and final settlement of all liability to Tetra. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded a gain from settlement of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
In December of 2016, DeLage Landen Financial Services, Inc. (“DeLage”), filed suit against the Company for failure to make the required payments under an equipment leasing contract that the Company had with DeLage (see Note 11). On January 24, 2017, DeLage received a default judgment against the Company in the approximate amount of $1.0 million, representing the balance owed on the lease, as well as additional interest, penalties and fees. The Company recognized this amount in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016. On February 8, 2017, a Stay of Execution was filed and under its terms the balance due was to be paid in variable monthly installments through January of 2019, with an implicit interest rate of 4.97%. The Company and DeLage disposed of certain equipment and reduced the balance owed to DeLage. A balance of $0.2 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020.
On December 7, 2016, the holders of the Tegal Notes (see Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) filed suit against the Company seeking payment for the amounts due under the notes in the aggregate of the principal of $341,612, and accrued interest of $43,000. A request for entry of default judgment was filed on January 24, 2017. On April 23, 2018, the holders of the Tegal Notes received a judgment against the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has repaid $44,544 of the principal amount of these notes.
The Company, as well as many of our subsidiaries, are defendants in a case filed in Broward County Circuit Court by TCA Global Credit Master Fund, L.P. The plaintiff alleges a breach by Medytox Solutions, Inc. of its obligations under a debenture and claims damages of approximately $2,030,000 plus interest, costs and fees. The Company and the other subsidiaries are sued as alleged guarantors of the debenture. The complaint was filed on August 1, 2018. The Company has recorded the principal balance and interest owed under the debenture agreement for the period ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Company and all defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, but have not recorded any potential liability related to any further damages. In May 2020, the SEC appointed a Receiver to close down the TCA Global Master Fund, L.P. over allegations of accounting fraud. The amount recorded by the Company as being owed to TCA was based on TCA’s application of prior payments made by the Company. The Company believes that prior payments of principal and interest may have been applied to unenforceable investment banking and other fees and charges. It is the Company’s position that the amount owed to TCA is less than what is set forth in Note 8 of accompanying consolidated financial statements and the Company intends to negotiate a settlement with the Receiver.
On September 13, 2018, Laboratory Corporation of America sued EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, in Palm Beach County Circuit Court for amounts claimed to be owed. The court awarded a judgment against EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. in May 2019 for approximately $155,000. The Company has recorded the amount owed as a liability as of December 31, 2020.
In August 2019, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. and Medytox Diagnostics, Inc. were sued by Beckman Coulter, Inc. in the same court under an agreement to purchase laboratory supplies. The plaintiff claims damages of approximately $124,000. The Company has disputed the amount owed and, in October 2020, entered into a settlement agreement to pay $35,000 as full and final settlement of this matter.
In July 2019, the landlord of Medytox Solutions, Inc. received a judgment in the amount of approximately $413,000 in connection with failure to pay under an office lease in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Company reached a settlement in May 2020 to resolve the judgment for the amount of $300,000, which was fully paid in 2020.
In February 2020, Anthony O. Killough sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, in New York State Court for the County of New York, for approximately $2.0 million relating to the promissory note issued by the Company in September 2019. In May 2020, the parties entered into a Stipulation providing for a payment of a total of $2,158,168 (which includes accrued interest) in installments through November 1, 2020. (See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not made the majority of the required payments and, as a result, approximately $1.9 million, which includes penalty interest at a rate of 20% per annum, is due and owing.
In February 2021, a supplier to the Company’s hospitals, Shared Medical Services, Inc., filed suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court for approximately $90,000 by virtue of default and for breach of contract and charges totaling approximately another $100,000. The Company disputes that it has any liability or responsibility under the agreements and has filed an initial response in the matter.
Following the Company’s decision to suspend operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2019 a number of vendors remain unpaid. A number have initiated or threatened legal actions. The Company believes it will come to satisfactory arrangements with these parties as it works toward reopening the hospital. The Company has accrued the amounts that it expects to owe in its financial statements. The Company is planning to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans and timing thereof have also been disrupted by the current pandemic.
Two former employees of Jamestown Regional Medical Center have filed suit alleging violations of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (“WARN”). The Court entered a default against the Company on August 14, 2019. The parties disagreed to the amount of damages, specifically to whether part-time employees are entitled to WARN act damages. The parties have agreed and are in support of a confidential settlement agreement, which is in the final stage of agreement and is expected to be concluded in the second quarter of 2021. The Company has recorded the estimated settlement amount in the accompanying statements of operations in “Net gain from legal settlements,” and in the accompanying balance sheets in accrued expenses.
In June 2019, CHSPSC, the former owners of Jamestown Regional Medical Center, obtained a judgment against the Company in the amount of $592,650. The Company has recorded $130,000 of this judgment as a liability at December 31, 2020, as management believes that a number of insurance payments were made to CHSPCS after the change of ownership and will likely offset the majority of the claim made by CHSPCS.
In August 2019, Morrison Management Specialists, Inc. obtained a judgment against Jamestown Regional Medical Center and the Company in Fentress County, Tennessee in the amount of $194,455 in connection with housekeeping and dietary services. The Company has recorded this liability as of December 31, 2020.
In November 2019, Newstat, PLLC obtained a judgment against Big South Fork Medical Center in Knox County, Tennessee in the amount of $190,600 in connection with the provision of medical services. The Company has recorded this liability as of December 31, 2020.

Dividend Policy
Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor. The holders of the Rennova Series F Preferred Stock and Series H Preferred Stock receive dividends at the same time any dividend is paid on shares of common stock in an amount equal to the amount such holder would have received if such shares of preferred stock were converted into common stock. Except for stock dividends, the holder of Rennova’s Series L Preferred Stock is not entitled to receive dividends on their shares. For each of Rennova’s Series M Preferred Stock and Series N Preferred Stock, dividends at the rate per annum of 10% of the stated value per share accrue on each outstanding share from and after the date of the original issuance of such share. Such accruing dividends accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and are cumulative and non-compounding, provided, however, that such accruing dividends are payable only when, as and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. No cash dividends may be paid on the common stock unless these accruing dividends are paid.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Certain of our financing agreements prohibit the payment of cash dividends.
The Company intends to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of its business. Future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, the Company’s financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, restrictions under the Company’s financing agreements and other factors. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any dividends of any kind will ever be paid on the Company’s common stock.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The Company’s 2007 Equity Participation Plan (“2007 Equity Plan”), as amended, which became available upon the completion of the Merger, authorized an aggregate of 50 million shares of common stock to be available for grant pursuant to the 2007 Equity Plan. The 2007 Equity Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance stock units, dividend equivalents, stock payments, deferred stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards, and performance-based awards. The option exercise price of all stock options granted pursuant to the 2007 Equity Plan was not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options may be exercised as determined by the Board, but in no event after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, provided that a vested nonqualified stock option may be exercised up to 12 months after the optionee’s death. Awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan were generally subject to vesting at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2007 Equity Plan terminated pursuant to its terms in September 2017. Grants made prior to the date of termination will remain outstanding until exercised, forfeited or expired pursuant to the terms of each grant.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical service and software sector between 2011 and 2014.
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
Our Services
We are a healthcare enterprise that delivers products and services to our patients. We operate in one business segment: Hospital Operations.
On January 13, 2017, we closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to Scott County Community Hospital, based in Oneida, Tennessee (the “Oneida Assets”). The Oneida Assets include a 52,000-square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. Scott County Community Hospital closed in July 2016 in connection with the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Pioneer Health Services, Inc. We acquired the Oneida Assets out of bankruptcy for a purchase price of $1.0 million. The hospital, which has since been renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, became operational on August 8, 2017.
On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire from Community Health Systems, Inc. certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jamestown, Tennessee, referred to as Jamestown Regional Medical Center. The purchase was completed on June 1, 2018 for a purchase price of $0.7 million. The hospital was acquired by a newly formed subsidiary, Jamestown TN Medical Center, Inc., and the hospital is an 85-bed facility of approximately 90,000 square feet on over eight acres of land, which offers a 24-hour Emergency Department with two spacious trauma bays and seven private exam rooms, inpatient and outpatient medical services and a Progressive Care Unit which provides telemetry services. The acquisition also included a separate physician practice known as Mountain View Physician Practice, Inc. Jamestown is located 38 miles west of Big South Fork Medical Center. The Company suspended operations at the hospital in June 2019, as a result of the termination of its Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed and is now intended for mid-2021.
In addition, on March 5, 2019, we closed an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) whereby we acquired certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jellico, Tennessee known as Jellico Community Hospital and an outpatient clinic located in Williamsburg, Kentucky known as CarePlus Center. The hospital and the clinic and their associated assets were acquired from Jellico Community Hospital, Inc. and CarePlus Rural Health Clinic, LLC, respectively. On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future.
Jellico Community Hospital was a 54-bed acute care facility that offered comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. Jellico was located 33 miles east of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The CarePlus Center offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis. The purchase price for the hospital and outpatient clinic was approximately $0.7 million. This purchase price was made available by Mr. Diamantis.
Our Hospital Operations generated net revenues of approximately $7.2 million and $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, based on collection history achieved, management recognized collection rates for our hospitals of approximately 14% and 14%, respectively. Going forward, we expect our Hospital Operations to provide us with a stable revenue base. In addition to the net revenues generated from our hospital operations, in 2019, we generated $75,460 of revenues related to non-hospital operations.
Discontinued Operations
Advanced Molecular Services Group and Health Technology Solutions, Inc.
On July 12, 2017, we announced plans to spin off our Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and in the third quarter 2017 our Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. On June 10, 2020, the Company signed an agreement for the separation of these entities into a public company. The agreement with TPT Global Tech, Inc. (“TPT”) (OTC: TPTW), a California-based public company, was to merge HTS and AMSG into a public company after TPT completed a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary, InnovaQor, Inc., with this public company. Rennova terminated its agreement with TPT on March 8, 2021 after numerous attempts to close the transaction as proposed failed due to uncertainty and last minute unviable demands from TPT that would have created a high risk to the future success of the project. Rennova is currently considering the actions of TPT with the belief that TPT acted outside of agreements that were in place and may have converted Rennova owned confidential information for their own benefit and business strategy. Rennova intends to pursue any remedy available to it under the law to recover money owed from TPT and to protect its technology and assets.
The Company continues to pursue options available to it to separate these entities and believes this can be accomplished in the second quarter of 2021. The strategic goal of this transaction is to create a separate public company which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans and create value for Rennova and its shareholders. The Company has reflected the amounts relating to AMSG and HTS (referred to as the AMSG & HTS Group) as a disposal group classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Clinical Diagnostics
Prior to our focus on hospital operations, our principal focus had been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. This sector has been fraught with difficulties over the past number of years as payers reduced reimbursement and coverage for diagnostics in this sector. The lack of consistency between payer’s policies and their requirement for proof of medical necessity created uncertainty for ordering physicians and testing laboratories and their ability to receive payment. During 2018, we reduced the number of laboratories we operated to one facility operated by EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. in Palm Beach County, Florida.
During the third quarter of 2020, we announced that we had reached a tentative agreement to sell our last clinical laboratory outside of its hospital labs, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., to TPT and as a result, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements. This proposed sale was terminated by Rennova on March 10, 2021, along with a lab management agreement and other permissions that had been granted by Rennova to TPT. Rennova is owed certain payments under the agreements and intends to take the necessary actions to secure payments owed by TPT.
Outlook
We believe that the transition of our business model from diagnostics to ownership of rural hospitals is now complete and once stabilized will create more predictable and stable revenue. Rural hospitals provide a much-needed service to their local communities and reduce our reliance on commission-based sales employees to generate sales. We currently operate one hospital and a rural clinic in the same general geographic location and we own another hospital and physician’s office at which operations are currently suspended. Owning a number of facilities in the same geographic location will create numerous efficiencies in purchasing and staffing and will enable the provision of additional, specialized and more valuable services that are needed by rural communities but cannot be sustained by a standalone rural hospital. We remain confident that this is a sustainable model we can continue to grow through acquisition and development and believe that we can benefit from the compliance and IT and software capabilities we already have in place. The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is more fully discussed below, has severely affected our operations and may cause such expectations not to be achieved or, even if achieved, not to be done in the expected timeframe.
Impact of the Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and we have taken steps intended to minimize the risk to our employees and patients. These steps have increased our costs and our revenues have been significantly adversely affected. Demand for hospital services has substantially decreased. As noted in Notes 1 and 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have received Paycheck Protection Program loans (“PPP Notes”) as well as Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Provider Relief Funds from the federal government. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a further extended period, we expect to incur significant losses and additional financial assistance may be required. Going forward, we are unable to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business. The nature and effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our balance sheet and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic in our service areas; government activities to mitigate the pandemic’s effect; regulatory changes in response to the pandemic, especially those affecting rural hospitals; and existing and potential government assistance that may be provided.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governments to seek to reduce its spread have severely impacted the economy and the health care industry in particular. Hospitals have especially been affected. Small rural hospitals, such as ours, may be overwhelmed by patients if conditions worsen in their local areas. Staffing costs, and concerns due to the potential exposure to infections, may increase, as may the costs of needed medical supplies necessary to keep the hospitals open. Doctors and patients may defer elective procedures and other health care services. Travel bans, social distancing and quarantines may limit access to our facilities. Business closings and layoffs in our local areas may result in the loss of insurance and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered.
Hospitalizations in Tennessee for COVID-19 increased throughout 2020 and appear to have peaked in December 2020. From third party information there have been 822,085 cases and 12,001 deaths as of April 12, 2021. The roll out of vaccinations is expected to significantly reduce the risk of death and reduce transmission of the virus and a return to more normal expectations is expected throughout 2021. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company and the operations of our hospitals. Our plans to reopen our Jamestown Regional Medical Center, whose operations were suspended in June 2019, have been disrupted by the pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed
On September 14, 2020, the Company announced that it had purchased and taken delivery of equipment to provide rapid testing for COVID-19 at Jellico Community Hospital, CarePlus Center and Big South Fork Medical Center in an effort to provide the Company with an additional revenue stream.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the current position of the business or the longer-term business strategy.
AMSG & HTS Group
We believe that a successful separation of the AMSG & HTS Group will allow each to focus on its own strengths and operational plans. The Company believes it will be able to recognize the expenditures to date with regard to the AMSG & HTS Group, which are approximately $14.9 million, as an investment after the separation is complete.
Result of Operations
Our loss from continuing operations before other income and (expense) and income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.2 million compared to a loss of $15.7 million for the same period a year ago. We attribute the increase in the operating loss primarily to the reduction in revenue.
We recorded a net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $17.6 million, as compared to a loss of $46.6 million for the same period of a year ago. The improvement was primarily due to other income (expense), net of approximately $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other income (expense), net of ($9.3) million in 2019, a $0.7 million net gain from legal settlements and a $2.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in interest expense of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 and a $1.3 million income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in the loss from continuing operations before other income (expense) and income taxes of $1.5 million.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances
We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes discussed below as critical to our business and to the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” including subsequently issued updates. This series of comprehensive guidance has replaced all existing revenue recognition guidance. There is a five-step approach outlined in the standard. In determining revenue, we first identify the contract according to the scope of ASU Topic 606 with the following criteria:
● The parties have approved the contract either in writing; orally by acknowledgement; or implicitly, based on customary business practices.
● Each party’s rights and the contract’s payment terms are identified.
● The contract has commercial substance.
● Collection is probable.
Under the accounting guidance, we no longer present the provision for doubtful accounts as a separate line item and our revenues are presented net of estimated contract and related allowances. We also do not present “allowances for doubtful accounts” on our consolidated balance sheets.
We review our calculations for the realizability of gross service revenues monthly to make certain that we are properly allowing for the uncollectable portion of our gross billings and that our estimates remain sensitive to variances and changes within our payer groups. The contractual allowance calculation is made based on historical allowance rates for the various specific payer groups monthly with a greater weight being given to the most recent trends; this process is adjusted based on recent changes in underlying contract provisions. This calculation is routinely analyzed by us based on actual allowances issued by payers and the actual payments made to determine what adjustments, if any, are needed.
Our revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are satisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. Our performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or per covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. Our revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process).
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
The collection of outstanding receivables for Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. Implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write offs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and write off data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable.
Contractual Allowances and Doubtful Accounts Policy
Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for credits and doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company has a standardized approach to estimating and reviewing the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for contractual credits and doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates. Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off. Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to provision for bad debts. We continue to review the provision for bad debt and contractual allowances.
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets according to Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). ASC 360 clarifies the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, including the disposal of business segments and major lines of business. Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options), including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260).
When the down round feature is included in an equity-classified freestanding financial instrument, the value of the effect of the down round feature is treated as a dividend when it is triggered and as a numerator adjustment in the basic EPS calculation. This reflects the occurrence of an economic transfer of value to the holder of the instrument, while alleviating the complexity and income statement volatility associated with fair value measurement on an ongoing basis.
In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” the Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
● Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
● Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets).
● Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net Revenues
Consolidated net revenues were $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $8.8 million. The decrease in net revenues was due to a reduction in revenues from Jamestown Regional Medical Center of $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. Operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center were temporarily suspended beginning in June 2019 pending reinstatement of the hospital’s Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed. The decrease in net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the 2019 was also, in large part, a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we attribute to the decrease in net revenues from Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center of $4.3 million and net revenues from Big South Fork Medical Center of $1.8 million. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe demand for our services was reduced. Also reducing revenue were staffing issues and supply shortages caused by cash constraints during the 2020 period, which required us to divert patients to third party facilities.
Net revenues for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include bad debt expense elimination of $7.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for doubtful accounts and $45.5 million and $99.3 million, respectively, for contractual allowances. In a continued effort to refine our revenue recognition estimates, the Company practices the full retrospective approach, evaluating and analyzing the realizability of gross service revenues quarterly, to make certain that we are properly allowing for bad debt and contractual adjustments.
Direct Costs of Revenue
Direct costs of revenue decreased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. We attribute the decrease primarily to Jamestown Regional Medical Center, which was temporarily suspended beginning in June 2019, as well as decreases in the number of patients served at Jellico Community Hospital, CarePlus Center and Big South Fork Medical Center. As a percentage of net revenues, direct costs increased to 163.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.2% in 2019. We attribute the increase in the direct costs as a percentage of net revenues to the COVID-19 pandemic and the diversion of patients to third party facilities due to staffing issues and supply shortages caused by cash constraints during the year ended December 31, 2020. While the number of patients served decreased, certain direct costs of revenue remained.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $4.5 million, or 27.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the temporary cessation of operations of Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2019. Also, contributing to the decrease were acquisition costs incurred in the 2019 period for the acquisition of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center on March 5, 2019 and reductions in insurance expense, compensation related expenses and directors fees.
Asset Impairment
As a result of the closure of Jellico Community Hospital on March 1, 2021, we determined that the hospital’s intangible asset, which was a certificate of need valued at $250,000, was impaired as of December 31, 2020.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $0.8 million in 2019 as certain fixed assets were fully depreciated during 2019.
Loss from Continuing Operations Before Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Taxes
Our operating loss increased by $1.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. We attribute the increase in the loss primarily to the reduction in revenues.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $8.0 million of HHS Provider Relief Funds, partially offset by ($1.4) million in penalties associated with non-payment of payroll taxes and ($1.2) million of loss on the sale of accounts receivable under a sales agreement. Other income (expense), net of ($9.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 included ($6.9) million in penalties for non-payment of debentures on the maturity dates, ($1.0) million of penalties related to past due payments of payroll taxes and ($1.4) million of losses on sales of accounts receivable under sales agreements.
Net Gain from Legal Settlements
We settled several legal proceedings during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in a net gain from legal settlements of $0.7 million. The settlement of obligations under a financing lease for property and equipment resulted in $0.9 million of the gain and we recorded $0.2 million in gains from other settlements. Partially offsetting the gains from legal settlements was a $0.4 million loss from a potential legal settlement related to a lawsuit by certain employees against the Company.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
In the year ended December 31, 2019, we realized a $0.3 million gain on the bargain purchase of Jellico Community Hospital, which was acquired on March 5, 2019. The gain was associated with the intangible asset acquired in the acquisition.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
We recorded a $2.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted from the Exchange, Redemption and Forbearance Agreement (the “Exchange and Redemption Agreement”) that we entered into on August 31, 2020. Under the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, stock and debentures and associated accrued interest were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Series N Preferred Stock. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement is more fully discussed below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Notes 9, 13 and 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instrument
The change in the fair value of derivative instrument for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.1 million resulted from a late payment penalty, which increased the principal amount of a debenture that contains a conversion feature indexed to the Company’s common stock.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.8 million compared to $21.7 million in 2019. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $6.3 million for default interest on past due debentures and note payable, $2.1 million for interest associated with loans from a former member of our Board of Directors and approximately $1.2 million of interest expense on notes payable and finance lease obligations. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $1.6 million for interest associated with loans from a former member of our Board of Directors, and $16.2 million for the amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs related to debentures and note payable, including $9.5 million for the modification of warrants issued in connection with debentures and approximately $3.6 million of interest expense on debentures, notes payable, finance lease obligations and the settlement of a prepaid forward purchase contract.
Benefit from Income Taxes
The net income tax benefit was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not incur income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the U.S. Congress approved the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act allows a five-year carryback privilege for federal net operating tax losses that arose in a tax year beginning in 2018 and through 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $1.1 million in income tax refunds from the carryback of certain of our federal net operating losses. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an additional $0.3 million of income tax benefits resulting from carryback adjustments related to prior years, partially offset by $0.1 million for the provision for state income taxes.
Net Loss from Continuing Operations
Our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.6 million compared to a loss of $46.6 million in 2019. The improvement was primarily due to other income (expense), net of approximately $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other income (expense), net of ($9.3) million in 2019, a $0.7 million net gain from legal settlements and a gain of $2.0 million on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in interest expense of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and a $1.3 million income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in the loss from continuing operations before other income (expense) and income taxes of $1.5 million.
The following table presents key financial metrics that management uses to monitor the results for our Hospital Operations:
(1) In addition to the net revenues generated from our hospital operations in 2019, we generated $75,460 of revenues related to non-hospital operations. Thus, the total net revenues were $16.0 million for 2019.
Our Hospital Operations have historically generated operating losses. We served less patients during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the suspension of operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center, which did not operate during 2020 following the termination of the Medicare program in June 2019. Also, reducing the number of patients served was the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as staffing issues and shortages of hospital supplies due to cash constraints, which required us to divert patients to third-party facilities during 2020. Net revenues and direct costs per patient increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 due to the type of services billed. Direct costs per patient were also impacted by the use of contract labor versus employees for patient care during the year ended December 31, 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we financed our operations from the issuances of equity, debentures and notes payable, loans from Mr. Diamantis, a former member of our Board of Directors, and the sale of accounts receivable under sales agreements. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020 we received approximately $2.3 million from PPP Notes and approximately $12.5 million from HHS Provider Relief Funds. On June 30, 2020, we entered into an exchange agreement with Mr. Diamantis, wherein we exchanged the amount owed to Mr. Diamantis for principal and interest on that date, which totaled $18.8 million, for shares of the Company’s Series M Convertible Preferred Stock. On August 31, 2020, we entered into the Exchange and Redemption Agreement with certain institutional investors in the Company as discussed in the paragraph below. Each of these financing transactions is more fully discussed in Notes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Under the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, the investors agreed to reduce their holdings of the Company’s debentures (the debentures are more fully discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) by approximately $19.3 million (including accrued interest and penalties) by exchanging the debentures and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series I-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the preferred stock is more fully discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) for 30,435.52 shares of the Company’s newly-authorized Series N Preferred Stock.
The investors continued to own, after the initial exchange, approximately $14.9 million (including accrued interest and penalties) of debentures, but agreed that the Company could redeem $10 million of its obligations under these debentures held by the investors at face value, plus accrued interest and penalties. These debentures included approximately $4.9 million under debentures and accrued interest that have been guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis. This redemption right was exercisable for 90 days, or until November 29, 2020. If it had been exercised in full, the remaining debentures held by the investors (totaling approximately $4.9 million, including accrued interest and penalties) would have been exchanged for approximately 4,900 additional shares of Series N Preferred Stock.
During the 90-day redemption period (or until the occurrence of certain specified events, if earlier), the investors agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies against the Company or Mr. Diamantis as a result of any existing defaults under the outstanding securities. During that period, additional interest did not accrue and would have been forgiven if the redemption right was exercised in full. If the redemption right was not exercised in full, all such amounts would become due and payable. The redemption right was not exercised and all such amounts have become due and payable.
Future cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, debt obligations and potential acquisitions will require management to seek additional equity or obtain additional credit facilities. The Company and our facilities may also receive additional government assistance. The sale/issuances of additional equity will result in additional dilution to our stockholders. A portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies. From time-to-time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses, products or technologies.
Going Concern and Liquidity
Under ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) (“ASC 205-40”), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required by ASC 205-40, this evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. Management has assessed the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with the requirement of ASC 205-40.
As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit of $56.5 million and $868.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company had a loss from continuing operations of approximately $17.6 million and cash used in operating activities of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of the date of this report, our cash is deficient and payments for our operations in the ordinary course are not being made. The continued losses and other related factors, including the payment defaults under the terms of outstanding notes payable and debentures as more discussed in Notes 8 and 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the filing date of this report. Our fixed operating expenses include payroll, rent, finance lease payments and other fixed expenses, as well as the costs required to operate our Hospital Operations. Our fixed operating expenses were approximately $1.5 million per month for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We need to raise additional funds immediately and continue to do so until we begin to realize positive cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan, which is to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals, raise any additional capital or secure the additional financing necessary to implement our current operating plan. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to significantly reduce our operating costs, increase our revenues and eventually achieve profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020 we received approximately $2.3 million from PPP Notes and Company-owned facilities received approximately $12.5 million of HHS Provider Relief Funds, $8.0 million of which was recorded as other income and the remainder was recorded as a liability at December 31, 2020. The PPP Notes and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries. The Company is in the process of applying for forgiveness for the PPP Notes and accrued interest. The HHS Provider Relief Funds are grants, not loans, and HHS will not require repayment, but providers are restricted and the funds must be used only for grant approved purposes as more fully discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We received approximately $1.2 million in cash from the issuance of a promissory note during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was used to repay amounts due under accounts receivable sales agreements and $2.1 million from the sale of accounts receivable under sales agreements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, Mr. Diamantis loaned the Company $7.6 million, the majority of which was used for working capital purposes, and we repaid Mr. Diamantis $4.2 million.
As of December 31, 2020, we were party to legal proceedings, which are presented in Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The following table presents our capital resources as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table presents the major sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The components of cash used in operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the following table:
Cash used by investing activities of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was used to purchase $0.4 million of hospital equipment, partially offset by $0.1 million provided by the sale of property and equipment. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.7 million was used primarily for the acquisition of Jellico Community Hospital.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $17.1 million and primarily included $7.6 million in loans from a former member of our Board of Directors, $2.3 million from PPP Notes, $12.5 million from HHS Provider Relief Funds, $2.1 million from the sales of accounts receivable and $1.2 million from the issuance of an installment note payable. Partially offsetting these cash receipts were $0.9 million in payments of debentures, $1.6 million of notes payable payments, $4.2 million in payments of loans owed to a former member of our Board of Directors, $1.7 million in payments of accounts receivable under sales agreements and $0.2 million of finance lease obligation payments. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $14.2 million primarily included $16.7 million in loans from a former member of our Board of Directors, $3.8 million from the issuances of debentures, $1.6 million in proceeds from notes payable and $2.6 million in proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable under sales agreements. Partially offsetting these cash receipts were $2.3 million in payments of loans from a former member of our Board of Directors, $5.0 in payments of a note payable, $2.8 million in payments of accounts receivable under sales agreements, $0.1 million of finance lease obligation payments and $0.1 million in payment of financing fees.
The Company had 39,648,679 and 964,894 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 313,000 shares of its common stock upon conversion of $277,994 of stated value of its Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock and 38,371,250 shares of its common stock upon conversion of $1,001,000 of stated value of shares of its Series N Preferred Stock.
These provisions have resulted in significant dilution of the Company’s common stock and have given rise to reverse splits of the Company’s common stock, including a reverse stock split effected on July 31, 2020, which is more fully described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The terms of certain of the warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures issued by the Company provide for reductions in the per share exercise prices of the warrants and the per share conversion prices of the debentures and preferred stock (if applicable and subject to a floor in certain cases), in the event that the Company issues common stock or common stock equivalents (as that term is defined in the agreements) at an effective exercise/conversion price that is less than the then exercise/conversion prices of the outstanding warrants, preferred stock or debentures, as the case may be. In addition, the majority of these equity-based securities contain exercise or conversion prices that vary based upon the price of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise/conversion (see Notes 3, 12, 13, 14 and 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). These provisions have resulted in significant dilution of the Company’s common stock and have given rise to reverse splits of the Company’s common stock, including a reverse stock split effected on July 31, 2020, which is more fully described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a result of these down round provisions, the potential common stock equivalents, including common stock outstanding totaled 8.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 25.9 billion at March 31, 2021.
OTHER MATTERS
Inflation
We do not believe inflation has a significant effect on the Company’s operations at this time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Off-balance sheet arrangements consist of transactions, agreements or contractual arrangements to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which we have:
● Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts.
● Any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets.
● Any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to the Company’s stock and classified in stockholder’s equity in the Company’s statement of financial position.
● Any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

RENNOVA HEALTH, INC.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Rennova Health, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rennova Health, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Consideration of the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has recognized recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, and currently has minimal revenue producing activities. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Complex Financing Transactions
Description of the Matter:
As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s financing transactions include warrants which contain down-round anti-dilution provisions. As a result, the exercise price of the warrants decreases and the warrants are revalued with each conversion of preferred stock or common stock issuance at a lower price than the warrant’s exercise price. The warrants are then revalued to their estimated fair value then recorded as a deemed dividend. Auditing management’s estimates of fair value requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to carefully examine to understand the true nature of the related agreements.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:
We gained an understanding of management’s process and methodology to develop the estimates. We reviewed the underlying warrant and preferred stock signed agreements. We evaluated management’s selection of a valuation method, tested the inputs used in the Black-Scholes calculation by agreeing terms of the underlying agreements and market information to third-party sites, and recalculated the deemed dividends. The Company used a specialist to perform the calculations and we gained an understanding of the specialist’s work. We assessed the knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company’s specialist and the specialist’s relationship to the Company. We evaluated the work of the specialist as delineated above. We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures related to these fair value measurements.
Evaluation of Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter:
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues are based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care, commercial, and governmental insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements or as mandated under government payer programs. Management continually reviews the contractual allowances estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.
Auditing management’s estimates of contractual allowances and implicit price concessions was complex and judgmental due to the significant data inputs and subjective assumptions utilized in determining related amounts.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:
To test the estimated contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its estimates. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and considered changes, if any, to the Company’s business and other relevant factors. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates as a source of potential corroborative or contrary evidence.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Rennova Health, Inc. (“Rennova”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a provider of health care services. In late 2016, the Company decided to pursue the opportunity to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals and is currently focused on implementing this business model. The Company now owns one operating hospital, a hospital that it plans to reopen and operate, a physician’s office in Tennessee and a rural clinic in Kentucky. One of the hospitals closed on March 1, 2021, as more fully discussed below and in Note 20. As the business focus has transitioned to rural hospital operations, the Company has made plans to sell its last clinical laboratory, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., and as a result, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company’s operations now consist of only one business segment, Hospital Operations.
Reverse Stock Split
On July 22, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-10,000 reverse stock split effective July 31, 2020 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). On May 7, 2020, the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the Company’s securities approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of all of the Company’s shares of common stock at a specific ratio within a range from 1-for-100 to 1-for-10,000, and granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio and timing of the reverse split on or prior to December 31, 2020.
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 10,000 shares of the Company’s common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock on July 31, 2020. In addition, the conversion and exercise prices of all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock, common stock purchase warrants, stock options, equity incentive plans and convertible debentures were proportionately adjusted at the applicable reverse split ratio in accordance with the terms of such instruments. In addition, proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split, other than as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares as no fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
All share, per share and capital stock amounts and common stock equivalents as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 presented herein have been restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
Jamestown Regional Medical Center Medicare Agreement
Following an inspection at Jamestown Regional Medical Center on February 5, 2019, the hospital was informed on February 15 that several conditions of participation in its Medicare agreement were deficient. The hospital was informed that if the deficiencies were not corrected by May 16 the Medicare agreement would terminate. A follow-up inspection on May 15 resulted in the determination that the hospital had failed to adequately correct the deficiencies highlighted and a notice of involuntary termination was issued that was effective on June 12, 2019. A significant percentage of patients at Jamestown Regional Medical Center are covered by Medicare and without any ability to get paid for these services the Company suspended operations at the hospital. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed and is now intended for mid-2021.
Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center
Effective March 5, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center, as more fully discussed in Note 6. Jellico Community Hospital was a 54-bed acute care facility that offered comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. The CarePlus Center services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis. On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building, as more fully discussed in Note 20. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future.
Impact of the Pandemic
A novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and we have taken steps intended to minimize the risk to our employees and patients. These steps have increased our costs and our revenues have been significantly adversely affected. Demand for hospital services has substantially decreased. As discussed in Note 8, we have received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. We have also received Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Provider Relief Funds from the federal government as more fully discussed below. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a further extended period, we expect to incur significant losses and additional financial assistance may be required. Going forward, the Company is unable to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect its business. The nature and effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our balance sheet and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic in our service areas; government activities to mitigate the pandemic’s effect; regulatory changes in response to the pandemic, especially those affecting rural hospitals; and existing and potential government assistance that may be provided.
Hospitalizations in Tennessee for COVID-19 increased throughout 2020 and appear to have peaked in December 2020. From third party information, there have been 822,085 cases and 12,001 deaths as of April 12, 2021. The roll out of vaccinations is expected to significantly reduce the risk of death and reduce transmission of the virus and a return to more normal expectations is expected throughout 2021. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company and the operations of our hospitals. Our plans to reopen our Jamestown Regional Medical Center, whose operations were suspended in June 2019, have been disrupted by the pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed.
On September 14, 2020, the Company announced that it had purchased and taken delivery of equipment to provide rapid testing for COVID-19 at Jellico Community Hospital, CarePlus Center and Big South Fork Medical Center in an effort to provide the Company with an additional revenue stream.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The closure, including a discussion of Jamestown Community Hospital’s equipment, is more fully discussed in Note 20. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the current position of the business or the longer-term business strategy.
HHS Provider Relief Funds
The Company received Provider Relief Funds from the United States Department of HHS provided to eligible healthcare providers out of the $100 billion Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund provided for in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The funds were allocated to eligible healthcare providers for expenses and lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were being released in tranches, and HHS partnered with UnitedHealth Group to distribute the initial $30 billion in funds by direct deposit to providers. As of December 31, 2020, Company-owned facilities have received approximately $12.5 million in relief funds. This included approximately $120,000 received by Jamestown Medical Center, Inc. where staff continue to be employed and remain engaged in the provision of healthcare services that qualify for relief. The fund payments are grants, not loans, and HHS will not require repayment, but providers are restricted and the funds must be used only for grant approved purposes. Based on an analysis of the compliance and reporting requirements of the Provider Relief Funds and the impact of the pandemic on our operating results through December 31, 2020, we recognized $8.0 million of these payments as income in 2020. The income has been recorded under the caption “Other income (expense)” and the unrecognized portion has been recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. The Company’s assessment of whether the terms and conditions for amounts received have been met considers all frequently asked questions and other interpretive guidance issued by HHS. On September 19, 2020, HHS issued a Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements (the “September 19, 2020 Notice”), which indicates that providers may recognize reimbursement for healthcare-related expenses, as defined therein, attributable to coronavirus that another source has not reimbursed and is not obligated to reimburse. Additionally, amounts received from the HHS that are not fully expended on eligible healthcare-related expenses may be recognized as reimbursement for lost revenues, represented as a negative change in year-over-year net patient care operating income. Providers may apply payments to lost revenues up to the amount of the 2019 net gain from healthcare-related sources or, for entities that reported a negative net operating gain in 2019, receipts from the HHS may be recognized up to a net zero gain/loss in 2020. On October 22, 2020, HHS issued an updated Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements and a Reporting Requirements Policy Update (together, the “October 22, 2020 Notice”), which includes two primary changes: (1) the definition of lost revenue is changed to refer to the negative year-over-year difference in 2019 and 2020 actual revenue from patient care related sources as opposed to the negative year-over-year change in net patient care operating income, and (2) the definition of reporting entities is broadened to include the parent of one or more subsidiary tax identification numbers that received general distribution payments, entities having providers associated with it that provide diagnoses, testing or treatment for cases of COVID-19, or entities that can otherwise attest to the terms and conditions. As codified in the October 22, 2020 Notice, the Company’s estimate of pandemic relief funds as of December 31, 2020 includes the allocation of certain general funds among subsidiaries. Regarding the amended definition of lost revenues, such change served to increase amounts eligible to be recognized as income, as compared to the September 19, 2020 Notice. Provider Relief Funds received through HHS that have not yet been recognized as income or otherwise have not been refunded to HHS as of December 31, 2020, are reflected within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and such unrecognized amounts may be recognized as income in future periods if the underlying conditions for recognition are met. As evidenced by the October 22, 2020 Notice, HHS’ interpretation of the underlying terms and conditions of such payments, including auditing and reporting requirements, continues to evolve. On January 15, 2021, the government issued “General and Targeted Distribution Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements,” (the “January 15, 2021 Notice”), which again provides guidance on reporting instructions and use of funds. Additional guidance or new and amended interpretations of existing guidance on the terms and conditions of such payments may result in changes in the Company’s estimate of amounts for which the terms and conditions are reasonably assured of being met, and any such changes may be material. Additionally, any such changes may result in the Company’s inability to recognize additional Provider Relief Fund payments or may result in the derecognition of amounts previously recognized, which (in any such case) may be material.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s estimate of the amount for which it is reasonably assured of meeting the underlying terms and conditions was updated based on, among other things, the September 19, 2020 Notice, the October 22, 2020 Notice, the January 15, 2021 Notice and the Company’s results of operations during 2020. Taking into account these countervailing factors, the Company believes that the amount recognized as of December 31, 2020 of approximately $8.0 million remains an appropriate estimate.
Going Concern
Under ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) (“Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-40”), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required by ASC 205-40, this evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. Management has assessed the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with the requirement of ASC 205-40.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit of $56.5 million and $868.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company had a loss from continuing operations of approximately $17.6 million and cash used in operating activities of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of the date of this report, our cash is deficient and payments for our operations in the ordinary course are not being made. The continued losses and other related factors, including the payment defaults under the terms of outstanding notes payable and debentures as more discussed in Notes 8 and 9, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the filing date of this report.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared assuming the Company can continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations through realization of assets, and the settling of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company plans to separate out its Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies in either a spin off or transaction with a publicly quoted company. In accordance with ASC 205-20 and having met the criteria for “held for sale”, the Company has reflected amounts relating to AMSG and HTS as disposal groups classified as held for sale and included as part of discontinued operations. AMSG and HTS are no longer included in the segment reporting following the reclassification to discontinued operations. The discontinued operations of AMSG and HTS are described further in Note 17.
In addition, during 2020, the Company announced plans to sell its last clinical laboratory, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., and as a result, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations for all periods presented, as more fully discussed in Note 17.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. Jellico Community Hospital had been operating at a loss since it was acquired by the Company in March 2019. The Company’s core operating businesses are now a rural hospital, a physician’s office, CarePlus Center and a hospital that it plans to reopen and operate, which is a specialized marketplace with a requirement for capable and knowledgeable management. The Company’s current financial condition may make it difficult to attract and maintain adequate expertise in its management team to successfully operate these businesses.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan, which is to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals, raise any additional capital or secure the additional financing necessary to implement its current operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise adequate capital to fund its operations and repay its outstanding debentures and other past due obligations, fully align its operating costs, increase its revenues, and eventually regain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in accordance with Regulation S-X of the SEC. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rennova Health, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Comprehensive Loss
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, comprehensive loss was equal to the net loss amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include the estimates of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including hospital acquisitions, reserves, contractual allowances and write-downs related to receivables, the recoverability of long-lived assets, stock based compensation, the valuation allowance relating to the Company’s deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and derivative instruments, income from HHS Provider Relief Funds, deemed dividends and debt discounts, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates and would impact future results of operations and cash flows.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had minimal cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” including subsequently issued updates. This series of comprehensive guidance has replaced all existing revenue recognition guidance. There is a five-step approach outlined in the standard. In determining revenue, we first identify the contract according to the scope of ASU Topic 606 with the following criteria:
● The parties have approved the contract either in writing; orally by acknowledgement; or implicitly, based on customary business practices.
● Each party’s rights and the contract’s payment terms are identified.
● The contract has commercial substance.
● Collection is probable.
Under the accounting guidance, we no longer present the provision for doubtful accounts as a separate line item and our revenues are presented net of estimated contract and related allowances. We also do not present “allowances for doubtful accounts” on our consolidated balance sheets.
We review our calculations for the realizability of gross service revenues monthly to make certain that we are properly allowing for the uncollectable portion of our gross billings and that our estimates remain sensitive to variances and changes within our payer groups. The contractual allowance calculation is made based on historical allowance rates for the various specific payer groups monthly with a greater weight being given to the most recent trends; this process is adjusted based on recent changes in underlying contract provisions. This calculation is routinely analyzed by us based on actual allowances issued by payers and the actual payments made to determine what adjustments, if any, are needed.
Our revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are satisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. Our performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or per covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. Our revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process). There were no adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost reports filed during 2020 and 2019.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. The Company considers the poverty level in determining whether patients qualify for free or reduced cost of care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
The collection of outstanding receivables for Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. Implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical write offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and write off data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated contractual allowance amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, estimated contractual allowances of $45.5 million and $99.3 million, respectively, and bad debt of $7.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively, have been recorded as reductions to our accounts receivable balances to enable us to record our revenues and accounts receivable at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
To quantify the total impact of the trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. Total uncompensated care as a percentage of gross revenues was 1.42% and 7% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Contractual Allowances and Doubtful Accounts Policy
Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for credits and doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company has a standardized approach to estimating and reviewing the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for contractual credits and doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates. Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off. Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to provision for bad debts. As required by Topic 606, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, after bad debt and contractual and related allowance adjustments to revenues of $52.6 million and $107.8 million, respectively, we reported net revenues of $7.2 million and $16.0 million. We continue to review the provision for bad debt and contractual and related allowances. See Note 4 - Accounts Receivable.
Leases, Including the Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires leases with durations greater than 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet, effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Prior period financial statement amounts and disclosures have not been adjusted to reflect the provisions of the new standard. We elected the package of transition provisions available which allowed us to carryforward our historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. We lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related right-of-use assets and right-of-use obligations at the present value of lease payments over the term. We do not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Our operating and finance leases are more fully discussed in Note 11.
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets according to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). ASC 360 clarifies the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, including the disposal of business segments and major lines of business. Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. The Company recorded the impairment of an intangible asset of $250,000 during 2020 as more fully discussed in Note 6. The Company did not record an asset impairment charge during 2019.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value, Including the Adoption of ASU 2017-11
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options), including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260).
When the down round feature is included in an equity-classified freestanding financial instrument, the value of the effect of the down round feature is treated as a dividend when it is triggered and as a numerator adjustment in the basic EPS calculation. This reflects the occurrence of an economic transfer of value to the holder of the instrument, while alleviating the complexity and income statement volatility associated with fair value measurement on an ongoing basis. The incremental value of the debentures and warrants as a result of the down round provisions of $256.4 million and $123.9 million were recorded as deemed dividends for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 12 for an additional discussion of derivative financial instruments.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, future tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts reported in the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on future income tax liabilities and assets is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. Future income tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be realized. When projected future taxable income is insufficient to provide for the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company recognizes a valuation allowance (see Note 15).
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. Based on its analysis, the Company has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) allocable to common shareholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of common stock equivalents. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, including stock options and warrants outstanding for the period as determined using the treasury stock method. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation when their effect would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share applicable to common shareholders is the same for periods with a net loss. See Note 3 for the computation of loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Note 3 - Loss per Share
Basic and diluted loss per share is computed by dividing (i) loss available to common shareholders, by (ii) the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income of the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic loss per share is the same as diluted loss per share.
The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Diluted loss per share excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following potential common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect was anti-dilutive:
The terms of certain of the warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures issued by the Company provide for reductions in the per share exercise prices of the warrants and the per share conversion prices of the debentures and preferred stock (if applicable and subject to a floor in certain cases), in the event that the Company issues common stock or common stock equivalents (as that term is defined in the agreements) at an effective exercise/conversion price that is less than the then exercise/conversion prices of the outstanding warrants, preferred stock or debentures, as the case may be. In addition, many of these equity-based securities contain exercise or conversion prices that vary based upon the price of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise/conversion (see Notes 12, 13 and 14). These provisions have resulted in significant dilution of the Company’s common stock and have given rise to reverse splits of the Company’s common stock. As a result of these down round provisions, the potential common stock and common stock equivalents totaled 25.9 billion at March 31, 2021 as more fully discussed in Note 20. See Note 14 regarding a discussion of the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock.
Note 4 - Accounts Receivable and Income Tax Refunds Receivable
Accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
The allowance for discounts reflected in the table above increased as a percentage of accounts receivable to 78% at December 31, 2020 compared to 63.0% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for discounts varies based on changes in historical contractual allowance rates.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, bad debt expense was $7.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The allowance for bad debts decreased by $3.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. The Company’s policy is to write off accounts receivable balances against the allowance for bad debts once an accounts receivable ages past a specified number of days.
Accounts Receivable Sales Agreements and Installment Promissory Note
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into six accounts receivable sales agreements under which the Company sold $3.3 million of accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis for a purchase price paid to the Company of $2.2 million, less $0.1million of origination fees. Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $1.7 million was outstanding and owed under the accounts receivable sales agreements.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into five accounts receivable sales agreements. The aggregate amount of accounts receivable sold on a non-recourse basis during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.9 million. The aggregate purchase price paid to the Company was $2.6 million, less $0.1 million of origination fees. Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, $1.1 million was outstanding and owed under these accounts receivable sales agreements. On January 29, 2020, the Company entered into a Secured Installment Promissory Note (the “Installment Note”) in the principal amount of $1.2 million, less $0.1 million in origination fees, the proceeds of which were used to satisfy in full the amounts due under accounts receivable sales agreements. The Installment Note is more fully discussed in Note 8.
Income Tax Refunds Receivable
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.4 million of income tax refunds receivable. During 2020, the U.S. Congress approved the CARES Act, which allows a five-year carryback privilege for federal net operating tax losses that arose in a tax year beginning in 2018 and through the current tax year, that is, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 million in refunds from the carryback of certain of its federal net operating losses. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $0.3 million in refunds related to other net operating loss carryback adjustments and it received income tax refunds of $0.6 million related to the audit of the Company’s 2015 Federal tax return. The Company’s federal net operating losses are more fully discussed in Note 15.
Note 5 - Property and Equipment
Property and equipment at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
On March 5, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. The Company acquired property and equipment of $0.5 million for the Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center acquisitions. These acquisitions are more fully discussed in Note 6.
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The impact of the closure of the hospital on its property and equipment is discussed in Note 20. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the current position of the business or the longer-term business strategy.
Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their respective lives. The buildings are being depreciated over 39 years, leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the lease(s) and the remaining equipment is being depreciated over lives ranging from three to seven years. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management periodically reviews the valuation of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for potential impairment. Management did not recognize any impairment of these assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Note 6 - Acquisitions
Purchase Agreement re Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center
Effective March 5, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. Jellico Community Hospital was a 54-bed acute care facility that offered comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. The CarePlus Center offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis. On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building, as more fully discussed in Note 20. This closure is not expected to have a negative impact on the current position of the business or the longer-term business strategy.
The purchase price was $658,537. This purchase price was made available by Mr. Christopher Diamantis, a former member of the Company’s Board of Directors. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $908,537, including $250,000 of diligence, legal and other costs associated with the acquisition. The acquisition costs were fully expensed in 2019.
The fair value of the purchase consideration paid to the sellers was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under U.S. GAAP. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805 the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values and consolidated with those of the Company.
The fair value of the assets acquired, net of the liabilities assumed, was $0.9 million. The excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible assets acquired over the purchase price was $250,000 and has been treated as a gain on bargain purchase in accordance with ASC 805. The gain was due to the value of the intangible assets acquired. After evaluation, no adjustments were made to the preliminary allocation set forth below. The purchase price allocation was based, in part, on management’s knowledge of hospital operations.
The following table shows the allocation of the purchase price of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center to the acquired identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed:
Impairment of Jellico Intangible Asset -Certificate of Need
As a result of the closure of Jellico Community Hospital on March 1, 2021, as more fully discussed in Note 20, we determined that the hospital’s intangible asset, which was a certificate of need valued at $250,000, was impaired as of December 31, 2020.
Unaudited Pro-Forma
The following presents the unaudited pro-forma combined results of operations of the Company and Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro-forma results of operations are presented for information purposes only. The unaudited pro-forma results of operations are not intended to present actual results that would have been attained had the acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2019 or to project potential operating results as of any future date or for any future periods.
Note 7 - Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
Accrued payroll and related liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included approximately $2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for penalties associated with approximately $4.4 million of accrued past due payroll taxes as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $4.4 million of HHS Provider Relief funds as more fully discussed in Note 1.
Accrued interest decreased by $0.2 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. On June 30, 2020, the Company exchanged loans and the related accrued interest owed to Mr. Diamantis, a former member of our Board of Directors, outstanding as of that date for shares of the Company’s newly-issued Series M Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series M Preferred Stock”) as more fully discussed in Notes 8 and 14. On August 31, 2020, the Company exchanged certain debentures and associated accrued interest outstanding as of that date for shares of its newly-issued Series N Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series N Preferred Stock”) and the interest accrued on certain outstanding debentures was reduced as more fully discussed in Note 9. Accrued interest at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included accrued interest of $0.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, on loans made to the Company by Mr. Diamantis.
Note 8 - Notes Payable
The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a number of loans with unrelated parties. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, notes payable consisted of the following:
Notes Payable - Third Parties
The Company did not make the required monthly principal and interest payments due under the TCA Debenture for the period from October 2016 through March 2017. On February 2, 2017, the Company made a payment to TCA in the amount of $0.4 million, which was applied to accrued and unpaid interest and fees, including default interest, as of the date of payment. On March 21, 2017, the Company made a payment to TCA in the amount of $0.75 million, of which approximately $0.1 million was applied to accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the TCA Debenture. Also on March 21, 2017, the Company entered into a letter agreement with TCA, which (i) waived any payment defaults through March 21, 2017; (ii) provided for the $0.75 million payment discussed above; (iii) set forth a revised repayment schedule whereby the remaining principal plus interest aggregating to approximately $2.6 million was to be repaid in various monthly installments from April of 2017 through September of 2017; and (iv) provided for payment of an additional service fee in the amount of $150,000, which was due on June 27, 2017, the day after the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Company; which amount was reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2020. In addition, TCA entered into an inter-creditor agreement with the purchasers of the convertible debentures (see Note 9) which sets forth rights, preferences and priorities with respect to the security interests in the Company’s assets. On September 19, 2017, the Company entered into a new agreement with TCA, which extended the repayment schedule through December 31, 2017. The remaining debt to TCA remains outstanding and TCA has made a demand for payment. In May 2020, the SEC appointed a Receiver to close down the TCA Global Master Fund, L.P. over allegations of accounting fraud. The amount recorded by the Company as being owed to TCA was based on TCA’s application of prior payments made by the Company. The Company believes that prior payments of principal and interest may have been applied to unenforceable investment banking and other fees and charges. It is the Company’s position that the amount owed to TCA is less than the amount set forth above.
The Company did not make the second annual principal payment under the Tegal Notes that was due on July 12, 2016. On November 3, 2016, the Company received a default notice from the holders of the Tegal Notes demanding immediate repayment of the outstanding principal of $341,612 and accrued interest of $43,000. On December 7, 2016, the Company received a breach of contract complaint with a request for the entry of a default judgment (see Note 16). On April 23, 2018, the holders of the Tegal Notes received a judgment against the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has paid $44,544 of principal amount of these notes.
On September 27, 2019, the Company issued a promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $1.9 million and received proceeds of $1.5 million, which was net of a $0.3 million original issue discount and $0.1 million in financing fees. The first principal payment of $1.0 million was due on November 8, 2019 and the remaining $0.9 million was due on December 26, 2019. These payments were not made. In February 2020, the note holder sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, in New York State Court for the County of New York, for approximately $2.2 million for non-payment of the promissory note. In May 2020, the Company, Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, and the note holder entered into a Stipulation providing for a payment of a total of $2.2 million (which included accrued “penalty” interest as of that date) in installments through November 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $450,000 has been paid in cash and $1.9 million, including $0.5 million of accrued “penalty” interest, remains past due. The Stipulation is more fully discussed in Note 16.
On January 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Installment Note in the principal amount of $1.2 million. The Company used the proceeds to satisfy in full the amounts due under accounts receivable sales agreements. These sales agreements are more fully discussed in Note 4. Pursuant to the Installment Note, weekly installment payments ranging from $22,500 to $34,000 were due on or before February 5, 2020 through on or before October 21, 2020, the maturity date. The Installment Note, which was issued with an original issue discount in the amount of approximately $0.1 million, is non-interest bearing and subject to late-payment fees of 10%. The Company made payments totaling $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $0.1 million is past due, including $9,850 of late payment penalties.
As of April 20, 2020 and through May 1, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries received PPP loan proceeds in the form of promissory notes (the “PPP Notes”) in the aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million. The PPP Notes and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries. No collateral or guarantees were provided in connection with the PPP Notes. The unforgiven portion of the PPP Notes are payable over two years at an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, with a deferral of payments for the first sixteen months. Beginning sixteen months from the dates of issuance, the Company is required (if not forgiven) to make monthly payments of principal and interest to the lenders. The aggregate monthly payment of all of the PPP Notes is approximately $0.1 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loans, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loans, in whole or in part. The Company is in the process of applying for forgiveness of the PPP Notes.
Note Payable - Related Party
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, note payable - related party consisted of the following:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Mr. Diamantis loaned the Company $7.6 million, the majority of which was used for working capital purposes, and the Company repaid Mr. Diamantis $4.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis advanced the Company $9.9 million, which was used for the settlement of a prepaid forward purchase contract, $0.7 million for the purchase of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center as more fully discussed in Note 6 and $6.7 million that was used primarily for working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid Mr. Diamantis $2.3 million. On June 30, 2020, the Company exchanged the total amount owed to Mr. Diamantis on that date for outstanding loans and accrued interest, net of repayments, which was approximately $18.8 million, for shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock. The Series M Preferred Stock is more fully discussed in Note 14.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued interest of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, on the loans from Mr. Diamantis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued interest on the loans from Mr. Diamantis totaled $0.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Interest accrues on loans from Mr. Diamantis at a rate of 10% on the majority of the amounts loaned. In addition, the Company incurs interest expense related to the amounts Mr. Diamantis borrows from third-parties to loan to the Company.
Note 9 - Debentures
The carrying amount of all outstanding debentures as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
Payment of all outstanding debentures totaling $12.7 million, including late-payment penalties, at December 31, 2020 was past due by the debentures’ original terms and the Company recorded approximately $6.9 million of non-payment penalties during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the payment defaults.
Two million dollars ($2.0 million) of principal balance of outstanding debentures issued in March 2017 (the “March 2017 Debentures”) were not paid as of March 21, 2019, the maturity date, $5.9 million of principal balance of outstanding debentures issued in September 2017 (the “September 2017 Debentures”) were not paid as of September 19, 2019, the maturity date, $11.2 million of principal balance of debentures issued during 2018 (“the 2018 Debentures”) were not paid as of September 19, 2019, the maturity date, and $3.9 million of principal balance of debentures issued during 2019 (“the 2019 Debentures”) were not paid as of December 31, 2019, the maturity date. The Company has incurred penalties in connection with these non-payments in the amount of $6.9 million as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company has accrued penalty interest at the rate of 18% per annum, or $7.4 million, as of December 31, 2020 as a result of the non-payments. On August 31, 2020, the Company and the debenture holders entered into the Exchange, Redemption and Forbearance Agreement (the “Exchange and Redemption Agreement”) as more fully discussed below.
March 2017 Debentures
The outstanding March 2017 Debentures totaling $2.6 million, including late-payment penalties, are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion price which has been adjusted pursuant to the terms of the March 2017 Debentures to $0.0118 per share on December 31, 2020, due to prices at which the Company has subsequently issued shares of common stock. The March 2017 Debentures contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. The conversion price is subject to reset in the event of offerings or other issuances of common stock, or rights to purchase common stock, at a price below the then conversion price, as well as other customary anti-dilution protections as more fully described in the debentures. The conversion price of the March 2017 Debentures on December 31, 2020 stated above, reflects an amendment to remove a floor in the conversion price of the debentures as well as other adjustments for dilutive issuances, which triggered the down round provisions in the March 2017 Debentures. The March 2017 Debentures are secured by all of the Company’s assets and they are guaranteed by several of the Company’s subsidiaries. Between March 22, 2017 and December 31, 2020, holders of the March Debentures converted an aggregate of $14.0 million of these debentures into 426 shares of common stock.
September 2017 Debentures
The September 2017 Debentures contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Company’s obligations under the September 2017 Debentures were secured by a security interest in all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ assets. On October 30, 2017, the Company entered into exchange agreements (“Exchange Agreements”) with the holders of the September 2017 Debentures to provide that the holders could, from time to time, exchange, at the Company’s option, their September 2017 Debentures for shares of a newly-authorized Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series I-2 Preferred Stock”) (See Note 13). As of December 31, 2020, a total of $3.1 million of September 2017 Debentures were converted into 3916.67 shares of Series I-2 Preferred Stock. On August 31, 2020, the Company and the debenture holders entered into the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, which is more fully discussed below, wherein the remaining principal balance of September 2017 Debentures on that date of $7.7 million, including late-payment penalties, were exchanged for shares of Series N Preferred Stock.
The 2018 Debentures
On March 5, 2018, May 14, 2018, May 21, 2018 and June 28, 2018, the Company closed offerings of $6.8 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures due September 19, 2019. The Company received proceeds of $5.5 million in the offerings net of the original issue discount of $1.3 million. On July 16, 2018, August 2, 2018, September 6, 2018 and November 8, 2018, the Company entered into Additional Issuance Agreements (the “Issuance Agreements”), with two existing institutional investors of the Company. Under the Issuance Agreements, the Company issued $4.3 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures due September 19, 2019 and received proceeds of $3.5 million. The conversion terms of these debentures are the same as those in the March 2017 Debentures, as more fully described above, with the exception of the conversion price, which is $0.052 at December 31, 2020 and is subject to a floor of $.052 per share. On August 31, 2020, the Company and the debenture holders entered into the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, which is more fully discussed below, wherein $8.9 million of principal balance, including late-payment penalties, of the 2018 Debentures were exchanged for shares of a newly-authorized Series N Preferred Stock.
Debentures Issued in 2019
The Company issued debentures on February 24, 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000 and on March 27, 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000. Both of these debentures were guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis and were originally due on June 3, 2019. The maturity dates of these debentures were extended to December 31, 2019 and the terms were changed so that commencing on August 17, 2019 the debentures bore interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 2.5% per month (increasing to 5% per month on October 12, 2019), payable quarterly beginning on October 1, 2019. All overdue accrued and unpaid interest entailed a late fee equal to the lesser of 24% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
The Company issued debentures on May 12, 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000. These debentures were guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis and were due on June 3, 2019. In addition, the Company issued debentures on June 5, 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $125,000 and on June 7, 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000. These debentures were also guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis and were due on July 20, 2019. The maturity dates of these debentures were extended to December 31, 2019 and the terms were changed so that commencing on August 17, 2019 the debentures bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 2.5% per month (increasing to 5% per month on October 12, 2019), payable quarterly beginning on October 1, 2019. All overdue accrued and unpaid interest entailed a late fee equal to the lesser of 24% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
On June 13, 2019, the Company closed an offering of $1,250,000 aggregate principal amount of debentures with certain existing institutional investors pursuant to the terms of a Bridge Debenture Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2019 (the “June 13 Agreement”) and received proceeds of $1,250,000. The June 13 Agreement provided that on or prior to June 30, 2019, at the mutual election of the Company and the investors, the investors could purchase an additional $1,250,000 principal amount on the same terms and conditions as provided in the June 13 Agreement. Under the June 13 Agreement, the maturity date of the debentures issued on February 24, 2019, March 27, 2019, May 12, 2019, June 5, 2019 and June 7, 2019 were extended to December 31, 2019 and the terms were changed such that they have the same interest terms as contained in the June 13, 2019 debentures, as more fully discussed below.
On June 21, 2019, the Company and the investors agreed that the Company would issue, and the investors would purchase, $250,000 principal amount of debentures and on June 24, 2019 the Company and the investors agreed that the Company would issue, and the investors would purchase, an additional $1,020,000 aggregate principal amount of debentures. In connection with the issuances of the June 21, 2019 and June 24, 2019 debentures, the Company received total proceeds of $1,270,000.
The June 13, 2019, June 21, 2019 and June 24, 2019 debentures (collectively, the “June 2019 Debentures”) are secured and guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries on the same terms as provided in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2017. Commencing on August 17, 2019, the June 2019 Debentures bore interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 2.5% per month (increasing to 5% per month on October 12, 2019), payable quarterly beginning on October 1, 2019. All overdue accrued and unpaid interest entailed a late fee equal to the lesser of 24% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Christopher Diamantis is a guarantor of the June 2019 Debentures.
The debentures issued in 2019 were not paid on December 31, 2019, the maturity date. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company accrued $1.2 million of late-payment penalties as a result of the non-payments.
In January 2020, the Company and Mr. Diamantis entered into a Forbearance Agreement with certain debenture holders under which Mr. Diamantis paid the debenture holders $50,000 for legal fees and $220,000 in principal payments on debentures that were issued in February 2019. In addition, Mr. Diamantis, who had guaranteed certain of the debentures, agreed to grant the debenture holders security interests in certain potential legal settlements funds that may become due to Mr. Diamantis. The Forbearance Agreement, which terminated on March 15, 2020, required the Company and Mr. Diamantis to repay the debenture holders a total of $4.9 million on or before the termination date, of which $4.7 million was not repaid. During May 2020, the Company repaid $0.5 million of the debentures. On June 30, 2020, the Company received a formal notice of default and demand for full payment of the $29.2 million of outstanding debentures on that date plus accrued interest. The Company repaid $0.2 million of the debentures in July 2020.
As a result of the Exchange and Redemption Agreement discussed below, the interest rate on all of the debentures issued in 2019 was reduced to a rate of 18% per annum, and accordingly as of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded interest expense associated with these debentures of $0.9 million.
Exchange, Redemption and Forbearance Agreement
On August 31, 2020, the Company and the debenture holders entered into the Exchange and Redemption Agreement wherein they agreed to:
1)Exchange outstanding Series I-1 Preferred Stock and Series I-2 Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Series I-1 and I-2 Preferred Stock”) for shares of Series N Preferred Stock at the stated value of the Series I-1 and Series I-2 Preferred Stock, which was $6,257,616. The Series I-1 and Series I-2 Preferred Stock are more fully discussed in Note 13 and the Series N Preferred Stock is more fully discussed in Notes 13 and 14;
2)Exchange on August 31, 2020 outstanding debentures totaling $19.3 million, which included principal and penalties of $16.5 million and accrued interest of $2.8 million for Series N Preferred Stock with a stated value (and determined to be fair value) of $24.2 million;
3)Provide for the repayment of outstanding debentures and accrued interest of approximately $9.8 million at August 31, 2020, for a payment of $10.0 million in cash anytime on or before November 29, 2020;
4)Provide, if the payment in Number 3 above is made timely, to allow for the exchange of the outstanding non-convertible debentures issued in 2019, with a carrying value on Rennova’s book of $4.8 million at August 31, 2020, including penalties at 30% of the original principal balance and penalty interest calculated at 18% per annum, for Series N Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.9 million. Under this provision, the penalty interest is accrued at the rate of 18% per annum and not the original interest terms, which were 5% per month and 24% per annum on late payment of penalty interest, as a concession and to offset the premium paid for the exchange of the debentures noted in Number 2 above. This interest rate concession, which totaled $2.3 million at August 31, 2020, is permanent and will not be reversed in any event, including non-payment of the $10.0 million by November 29, 2020;
5)Provide that if the $10.0 million cash payment is made timely, no interest will accrue or be due under the outstanding debentures for the periods subsequent to August 31, 2020, however, interest will again accrue on these outstanding debentures at a rate of 18% per annum subsequent to August 31, 2020 if the $10.0 million cash payment is not made timely;
6)Provide that during the 90-day redemption period (or until the occurrence of certain specified events, if earlier), the investors will forbear from exercising any remedies against the Company or Mr. Diamantis as a result of any existing defaults under the outstanding securities; and
7)Provide that the embedded conversion options of the outstanding debentures noted in Number 3 above have been suspended as of August 31, 2020 and that the conversion terms will only be reinstated to their original terms after November 29, 2020 if the $10.0 million cash payment is not made.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, the Company recorded (i) a $2.0 million gain on the extinguishment of debt, a $0.3 million fair value adjustment to the debenture principal, partially offset by the reduction in interest expense of $2.3 million; and (ii) deemed dividends of $3.7 million as a result of the exchange of the debentures and Series I-1 and I-2 Preferred Stock into shares of the Series N Preferred Stock. The redemption right was not exercised and all such additional amounts have become due and payable.
The debentures issued during the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued at a discount of $0.1 million and accordingly, the Company realized a total of $3.8 million in proceeds from the issuances of debentures during 2019. The debentures issued in 2017 and 2018 were also issued with discounts. These discounts represented original issue discounts, the relative fair value of the warrants issued with the debentures, the value of the modifications of certain of these warrants, and the relative fair value of the beneficial conversion features of the debentures. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $16.2 million of such amortization of debt discount expense in connection with the debentures and warrants. These amounts included debt discount amortization that resulted from the modification of warrants as more fully discussed in Notes 12 and 14. All of the discounts associated with the debentures were fully amortized as of December 31, 2019. In addition to the amortization of discounts, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred interest expense on debentures of $6.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
The March 2017 Debentures and the September 2017 Debentures were issued with warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Outstanding warrants are more fully discussed in Note 14.
See Notes 3, 14 and 20 for a discussion of the dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible debentures, warrants and convertible preferred stock as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $256.4 million and $123.9 million of deemed dividends as a result of the down round provision of debentures and warrants. See Notes 2 and 12.
Note 10 - Related Party Transactions
In addition to the transactions discussed in Notes 6 and 8, the Company had the following related party activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Alcimede billed $0.5 million and $0.4 million for services for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, pursuant to a consulting agreement originally entered into in 2012. It is subject to annual renewals. Seamus Lagan, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole manager of Alcimede (see Note 14).
The Company’s staff accountant, Ms. Kristi Dymond, received approximately $82,500 as a loan after she purchased certain land and buildings at auction in Jellico, Tennessee, that were attached to or related to the Company’s business there. The Company had no part in Ms. Dymond’s decision to acquire the property but decided that it would provide her a loan in support of her intentions to assist the Company. The loan is secured by the property and as long as the loan remains outstanding the Company is permitted the use of the assets and the assets remain security for the loan.
The terms of the foregoing activity, including those discussed in Notes 6 and 8 are not necessarily indicative of those that would have been agreed to with unrelated parties for similar transactions.
Note 11 - Finance and Operating Lease Obligations
We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires leases with durations greater than 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet, effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. We elected the package of transition provisions available, which allowed us to carryforward our historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. We lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related right-of-use assets and right-of-use obligations at the present value of lease payments over the term. We do not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts.
Generally, we use our most recent agreed upon borrowing interest rate at lease commencement as our interest rate, as most of our operating leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate.
The following table presents our lease-related assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
The following table presents certain information related to lease expense for finance and operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1) Adjusts depreciation recorded in the prior year.
(2) Expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Other Information
The following table presents supplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under right-of-use operating and finance leases are as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in default under its finance lease obligations, therefore, the aggregate future minimum lease payments and accrued interest under this finance lease in the amount of $0.2 million are deemed to be immediately due. In July 2020, the Company entered into a settlement with the holder of one of the finance leases and paid $0.1 million as full and final settlement of the obligation as more fully discussed in Note 16.
Note 12 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value
In accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” the Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
● Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
● Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets).
● Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.
The estimated fair value of financial instruments is determined by the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies considered to be appropriate. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The following table sets forth the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table reconciles the changes in the liability categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020:
The Company utilized the following methods to value its derivative liability as of December 31, 2019 for the embedded conversion option valued at $455,336. The Company determined the fair value by comparing the discounted conversion price per share multiplied by the number of shares issuable at the balance sheet date to the actual price per share of the Company’s common stock multiplied by the number of shares issuable at that date with the difference in value recorded as a liability.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company extended the exercise period of the outstanding Series B Warrants (Series B Warrants are more fully discussed in Notes 12 and 14) twice, once to September 2019 and the second time to March 31, 2022 and recorded interest expense of $9.5 million, which represented the aggregate fair value of the modifications. The Company used the Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants as of the modification dates. Using the pre-modification terms and related assumptions of risk free rates ranging from 2.44% to 2.46%, volatility ranging from 182.9% to 204.4% and weighted average remaining lives of .24 years to .36 years, and the post-modification terms and related assumptions of risk free rates ranging from 2.23% to 2.49%, volatility ranging from 198.3% to 259.4% and weighted average remaining lives of .48 years to 2.89 years, the changes in the fair value of the warrant instruments as a result of the modifications were estimated to be $9.5 million.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the conversions of preferred stock triggered a further reduction in the conversion/ exercise prices of any debentures and warrants containing ratchet features that had not already ratcheted down to their floor. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the incremental fair value of the debentures and warrants as a result of the decreases in the conversion/exercise prices was measured using Black Scholes. The following assumptions were utilized in the Black Scholes valuation models in the year ended December 31, 2020: risk free rates ranging from 0.09% to 0.13%, volatility ranging from 170.3% to 295.2% and lives ranging from 0.10 to 1.65 years. The following assumptions were utilized in the Black Scholes valuation models in the year ended December 31, 2019: risk free rates ranging from 2.4% to 2.6%, volatility ranging from 189.5% to 273.1% and lives ranging from 0.3 to 3.2 years. The incremental value of the debentures and warrants as a result of the down round provisions of $256.4 million and $123.9 million were recorded as deemed dividends for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deemed dividends are also discussed in Notes 2 and 3.
Note 13 - Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock
The Company has 5,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock at a par value of $0.01. Issuances of the Company’s Preferred Stock included as part of stockholders’ deficit are discussed in Note 14. The following is a summary of the issuances of the Company’s Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock.
Series I-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock
On October 30, 2017, the Company closed an offering of $4,960,000 stated value of 4,960 shares of Series I-1 Preferred Stock. Each share of Series I-1 Preferred Stock had a stated value of $1,000. The offering was pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2017 (the “Purchase Agreement”), between the Company and certain existing institutional investors of the Company. The Company received proceeds of $4.0 million from the offering. Each share of Series I-1 Preferred Stock was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion price equal to 85% of the lesser of the volume weighted average market price of the common stock on the day prior to conversion or on the day of conversion. The conversion price was subject to “full ratchet” and other customary anti-dilution protections.
On October 30, 2017, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements with the holders of the September 2017 Debentures and the September 2018 Debentures (collectively, the “September Debentures”) to provide that the holders could, from time to time, exchange their September Debentures for shares of a Series I-2 Preferred Stock. The Exchange Agreements permitted the holders of the September Debentures to exchange specified principal amounts of the September Debentures on various closing dates starting on December 2, 2017 (debentures are more fully discussed in Note 9). At the holder’s option each holder could reduce the principal amount of September Debentures exchanged on any particular closing date, or elect not to exchange any September Debentures at all on a closing date. If a holder chose to exchange less principal amount of September Debentures or none at all, it could carry forward such lesser amount to a future closing date and then exchange more than the originally specified principal amount for that later closing date. For each $0.80 of principal amount of the debenture surrendered to the Company at any closing date, the Company would issue to the holder a share of Series I-2 Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1.00. From December 2, 2017 through March 1, 2018, any exchange under the Exchange Agreements was at the option of the holder. Subsequent to March 2018, any exchange was at the option of the Company. Each share of Series I-2 Preferred Stock was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion price equal to 85% of the lesser of the volume weighted average market price of the common stock on the day prior to conversion or on the day of conversion. The conversion price was subject to “full ratchet” and other customary anti-dilution protections.
The Company’s Board of Directors designated up to 21,346 shares of the 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as the Series I-2 Preferred Stock and the Company issued 3,907.67 shares of its Series I-2 Preferred Stock. Each share of Series I-2 Preferred Stock had a stated value of $1,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the holder converted 236.30 shares of Series I-2 Preferred Stock into 313,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the holder converted 1,078.63 shares of Series I-2 Preferred Stock into 940,075 shares of the Company’s common stock.
On August 31, 2020, the remaining outstanding shares of Series I-1 and Series I-2 Preferred Stock, which totaled 6,257.62 shares, were exchanged for the Company’s Series N Preferred Stock as more fully discussed below and in Note 9.
On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Exchange and Redemption Agreement with certain institutional investors in the Company wherein the investors agreed to reduce their holdings of the Company’s debentures, which are more fully discussed in Note 9, by approximately $19.3 million (including accrued interest and penalties) by exchanging the debentures and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series I-1 and Series I-2 Preferred Stock, which was 6,257.62 shares, for 30,435.52 shares of the Company’s Series N Preferred Stock. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement is more fully discussed in Note 9. The Series N Preferred Stock is more fully discussed in Note 14.

Genomas Inc. is included in the Company’s discontinued operations in the AMSG & HTS Group, which are discussed in Note 17. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock is one. Any shares of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding on the fifth anniversary of the issuance date will be mandatorily converted into common stock at the applicable conversion price on such date. The Series F Preferred Stock has voting rights. Each share of Series F Preferred Stock has one vote, and the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock as a single class.
On December 23, 2019, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Alcimede LLC (“Alcimede”), of which Seamus Lagan, our Chief Executive Officer, is the sole manager as previously stated. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of its Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series K Preferred Stock”) in exchange for the 250,000 shares of the Company’s Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series J Preferred Stock”) held by Alcimede. The holder of the Series J Preferred Stock was entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Company, but only out of funds that were legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8% of the stated value per annum on each share of Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock had been issued to Alcimede on July 23, 2018 and upon the issuance of the Series K Preferred Stock to Alcimede, the shares of Series J Preferred Stock were cancelled. Under the Agreement, Alcimede relinquished all rights to any cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series K Preferred Stock did not provide for cumulative dividends.
On May 4, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of its Series L Preferred Stock. On May 5, 2020, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with Alcimede. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of its Series L Preferred Stock in exchange for the 250,000 shares of the Company’s Series K Preferred Stock held by Alcimede. Upon the issuance of the Series L Preferred Stock to Alcimede, the shares of Series K Preferred Stock were cancelled. The Series L Preferred Stock was not convertible into common stock prior to December 1, 2020 and is not entitled to receive any dividends. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the ten trading days immediately prior to the conversion date.
Series M Convertible Preferred Stock Exchanged for Loans from Mr. Diamantis
On June 9, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of designation to authorize 30,000 shares of its Series M Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share. On June 30, 2020, the Company and Mr. Diamantis entered into an exchange agreement wherein Mr. Diamantis agreed to the extinguishment of the Company’s indebtedness to Mr. Diamantis totaling $18.8 million, including accrued interest, on that date in exchange for 22,000 shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. As a result of the exchange, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of approximately $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented the difference between the $18.8 million of debt and accrued interest exchanged and the value of the Series M Preferred Stock of $22.0 million. See Note 8 for a discussion of the Company’s indebtedness to Mr. Diamantis.
The terms of the Series M Preferred Stock were set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 16, 2020. In particular: (i) each holder of the Series M Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of the Company’s common stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. Each outstanding share of the Series M Preferred Stock shall represent its proportionate share of the 51% allocated to the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock in the aggregate. The Series M Preferred Stock shall vote with the common stock and any other voting securities as if they were a single class of securities; (ii) each share of the Series M Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 90% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the ten trading days immediately prior to the conversion date but in any event not less than the par value of the Company’s common stock; and (iii) dividends at the rate per annum of ten percent (10%) of the stated value per share shall accrue on each outstanding share of Series M Preferred Stock from and after the date of the original issuance of such share of Series M Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization). The dividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative and non-compounding; provided, however, that such dividend shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors and the Company shall be under no obligation to pay such dividends. No cash dividends shall be paid on the Company’s common stock unless the dividends are paid on the Series M Preferred Stock.
On August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock.
Series N Convertible Preferred Stock Exchanged for Series I-1 and Series I-2 Preferred Stock and Debentures
On August 31, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of designation to authorize 50,000 shares of its newly-authorized Series N Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share. On August 31, 2020, the Company and its debenture holders exchanged, under the terms of the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, certain outstanding debentures and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series I-1 Preferred Stock and Series I-2 Preferred Stock for 30,435.52 shares of the Company’s Series N Preferred Stock. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement is more fully discussed in Notes 9 and 13.
The terms of the Series N Preferred Stock were set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 1, 2020, In particular:
Voting Rights. Except as provided below or by law, the Series N Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights. However, as long as any shares of Series N Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series N Preferred Stock, (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series N Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, (b) amend its certificate of incorporation or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holders, (c) increase the number of authorized shares of the Series N Preferred Stock, or (d) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.
Dividends. Dividends at the rate per annum of 10% of the stated value per share shall accrue on each outstanding share of Series N Preferred Stock from and after the date of the original issuance of such share of Series N Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Accruing Dividends”). The Preferred Accruing Dividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative and non-compounding; provided, however, that such Preferred Accruing Dividends shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. No cash dividends shall be paid on the common stock unless the Preferred Accruing Dividends are paid.
Rank. The Series N Preferred Stock ranks with respect to dividends or a liquidation, (i) on parity with the common stock, the Company’s Series H Preferred Stock, the Company’s Series L Preferred Stock and the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock, (ii) senior to the Company’s Series F Preferred Stock, and (iii) junior to any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company afterwards created and ranking by its terms senior to the Series N Preferred Stock.
Conversion. Each share of the Series N Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the holder, into that number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the stated value of such share of Series N Preferred Stock, plus any accrued declared and unpaid dividends, by the conversion price. The conversion price is equal to 90% of the lowest VWAP during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the conversion date. Holders of the Series N Preferred Stock are prohibited from converting Series N Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 4.99% (or, upon election of the holder, 9.99%) of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after notice to the Company.
Liquidation Preference. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series N Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the stated value of the Series N Preferred Stock, plus any accrued declared and unpaid dividends thereon and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing thereon, for each share of the Series N Preferred Stock before any distribution or payment shall be made on any junior securities.
Redemption. At any time the Company shall have the right to redeem all, or any part, of the Series N Preferred Stock then outstanding. The Series N Preferred Stock subject to redemption shall be redeemed by the Company in cash in an amount equal to the stated value of the shares of the Series N Preferred Stock being redeemed plus all accrued declared and unpaid dividends.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the holder converted 1,001 shares of its Series N Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1,001,000 into 38,371,250 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s various classes of Preferred Stock included in Stockholders’ Deficit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Common Stock
The Company had 39,648,679 and 964,894 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 313,000 shares of its common stock upon the conversion of 236.30 shares of its Series I-2 Preferred Stock and 38,371,250 shares of its common stock upon the conversion of 1,001 shares of its Series N Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 940,075 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 1,078.63 shares of its Series I-2 Preferred Stock and 11,962 shares of common stock upon the cashless exercise of warrants.
Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents
The Company has outstanding options, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures. Exercise of the options and warrants, and conversions of the convertible preferred stock and debentures could result in substantial dilution of our common stock and a decline in its market price. In addition, the terms of certain of the warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures issued by us provide for reductions in the per share exercise prices of the warrants and the per share conversion prices of the debentures and preferred stock (if applicable and subject to a floor in certain cases), in the event that we issue common stock or common stock equivalents (as that term is defined in the agreements) at an effective exercise/conversion price that is less than the then exercise/conversion prices of the outstanding warrants, preferred stock or debentures, as the case may be. These provisions, as well as the issuances of debentures and preferred stock with conversion prices that vary based upon the price of our common stock on the date of conversion, have resulted in significant dilution of our common stock and have given rise to reverse splits of our common stock.
On August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis entered into the Voting Agreement with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. This means that the holders of Series M Preferred Stock have sufficient votes, by themselves, to approve or defeat any proposal voted on by the Company’s stockholders, unless there is a supermajority required under applicable law or by agreement. As a result of the Voting Agreement, as of the date of filing this report, the Company believes that it has the ability to ensure that it has and or can obtain sufficient authorized shares of its common stock to cover all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.
Stock Options
The Company maintained and sponsored the Tegal Corporation 2007 Incentive Award Equity Plan (the “2007 Equity Plan”). Tegal Corporation is the prior name of the Company. The 2007 Equity Plan, as amended, provided for the issuance of stock options and other equity awards to the Company’s officers, directors, employees and consultants. The 2007 Equity Plan terminated pursuant to its terms in September 2017. The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
As a result of the forfeiture of four unvested stock options during 2019, the Company reversed compensation expense previously recorded in prior years resulting in a net reduction of compensation expense of $51,899 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining contractual life was 5.37 years for options outstanding and exercisable. The intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0. As of December 31, 2020, there was no remaining compensation expense as all of the outstanding options had fully vested as of December 31, 2019. The Company estimated forfeiture and volatility using historical information. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues over the equivalent lives of the options. The expected life of the options represents the estimated period using the simplified method. The Company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and no assumption of dividend payment(s) is made in the model.
The following table summarizes information with respect to stock options outstanding and exercisable by employees and directors at December 31, 2020:
Warrants
The Company, as part of various debt and equity financing transactions, has issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of the anti-dilution provisions of outstanding warrants, the exercise prices of the warrants decreased and they became exercisable into an additional 4.5 billion and 58.2 million shares of common stock, respectively. These warrants were issued in connection with the issuances of the March 2017 Debentures and the September 2017 Debentures. These debentures are more fully discussed in Note 9.
Warrants Issued with March 2017 Debentures
In connection with the March 2017 Debentures, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock to several accredited investors. At December 31, 2020, these warrants were exercisable into an aggregate of approximately 4.1 billion shares of common stock. The warrants were issued to the investors in three tranches, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants (collectively, the “March Warrants”). At December 31, 2020, the Series A Warrants were exercisable for 1.5 billion shares of the Company’s common stock. They were exercisable upon issuance and have a term of exercise equal to five years. At December 31, 2020, the Series B Warrants were exercisable for 974.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock and were initially exercisable for a period of 18 months. During 2018, the Company extended the exercise period twice, once to March 21, 2019 and the second time to June 21, 2019 and during 2019 the Company again extended the exercise period twice, once to September 21, 2019 and a second time to March, 31, 2022. As a result of these extensions, the Company recorded additional interest expense as more fully discussed in Note 12. At December 31, 2020, the Series C Warrants were exercisable for 1.6 billion shares of the Company’s common stock and have a term of five years provided such warrants shall only vest if, when and to the extent that the holders exercise the Series B Warrants. At December 31, 2020, the Series A, Series B and Series C Warrants each have an exercise price of $0.0118 per share, which reflects adjustments pursuant to their terms. The Series A, Series B and Series C Warrants are subject to “full ratchet” and other customary anti-dilution protections. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, reductions in the exercise prices of the March Warrants have given rise to deemed dividends as more fully discussed in Notes 2, 3 and 12.
In connection with the September 2017 Debentures, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2020, these warrants were exercisable into approximately six shares of common stock. The warrants were issued to the investors in three tranches, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and Series C warrants (collectively the “September Warrants”). At December 31, 2020, the Series A Warrants were exercisable for an aggregate of two shares of the Company’s common stock. They were exercisable upon issuance and have a term of exercise equal to five years. At December 31, 2020, the Series B Warrants were exercisable for an aggregate of two shares of the Company’s common stock and were initially exercisable for a period of 18 months. During 2018, the exercise period of the Series B Warrants was extended to June 19, 2019. On March 27, 2019, the expiration date of these Series B Warrants was extended 90 days to September 21, 2019 and again on May 10, 2019 the expiration date was extended to March, 31, 2022. These extensions resulted in de minimus amounts of interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the Series C Warrants were exercisable for an aggregate of two shares of the Company’s common stock, and have a term of five years provided such Series C Warrants shall only vest if, when and to the extent that the holders exercise the Series B Warrants. At December 31, 2020, the September Warrants exercise price was $9,016,133 per share, which is the per share floor exercise price as a result of reverse stock splits of the Company’s common stock that have been effected since these warrants were issued.
The number of warrants issued, converted and outstanding as well as the exercise prices of the warrants reflected in the table below have been adjusted to reflect the full ratchet and other dilutive and down round provisions pursuant to the warrant agreements. As a result of the full ratchet provisions of the majority of the outstanding warrants (subject to a floor in some cases), subsequent decreases in the price of the Company’s common stock and subsequent issuances of the Company’s common stock or common stock equivalents at prices below the current exercise prices of the warrants have resulted in increases in the number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrants and decreases in the exercise prices.
The following summarizes the information related to warrant activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020:
See above and Notes 3, 12 and 20 for a discussion of the dilutive effect of the outstanding warrants.
Note 15 - Income Taxes
The benefit (provision) from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following:
The following reconciles the Federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management evaluates whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on Management’s evaluation, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and as such a valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Management has reviewed the provisions regarding assessment of their valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and based on that criteria determined that it should record a valuation allowance of $28.0 million and $22.1 million against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $98.4 million generated since 2016. It also has various state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the U.S. Congress approved the CARES Act, which allows a five-year carryback privilege for federal net operating tax losses that arose in a tax year beginning in 2018 and through the current tax year, that is, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 million in refunds from the carryback of certain of its federal net operating losses. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $0.3 million in refunds related to other net operating loss carryback adjustments and it received income tax refunds of $0.6 million related to the audit of the Company’s 2015 Federal tax return. See also Notes 4 and 16.
The Company recognizes the consolidated financial statement impact of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the states of Florida, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, California, Kentucky and Tennessee. The tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply.
Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies
Concentration of Credit Risk
Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising the client base. The Company does have significant receivable balances with government payers and various insurance carriers. Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. However, the Company continually monitors and evaluates its client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts and as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
A number of proposals for legislation continue to be under discussion which could substantially reduce Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) reimbursements to hospitals and clinical laboratories. Depending upon the nature of regulatory action, and the content of legislation, the Company could experience a significant decrease in revenues from Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is unable to predict, however, the extent to which such actions will be taken.
The Company maintains its cash balances in high credit quality financial institutions. The Company’s cash balances may, at times, exceed the deposit insurance limits provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings related to contractual disputes, employment matters, regulatory and compliance matters, intellectual property rights and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry which may inherently lend itself to legal matters. Management is aware that litigation has associated costs and that results of adverse litigation verdicts could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company’s policy is to expense legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the legal proceedings in the period in which the expense is incurred. Management, in consultation with legal counsel, has addressed known assertions and predicted unasserted claims below.
Biohealth Medical Laboratory, Inc. and PB Laboratories, LLC (the “Companies”) filed suit against CIGNA Health in 2015 alleging that CIGNA failed to pay claims for laboratory services the Companies provided to patients pursuant to CIGNA - issued and CIGNA - administered plans. In 2016, the U.S. District Court dismissed part of the Companies’ claims for lack of standing. The Companies appealed that decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which in late 2017 reversed the District Court’s decision and found that the Companies have standing to raise claims arising out of traditional insurance plans as well as self-funded plans. In July 2019, the Companies and EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. filed suit against CIGNA Health for failure to pay claims for laboratory services provided. Cigna Health, in turn, sued for improper billing practices. CIGNA’s case against the Company was dismissed on June 22, 2020. The suit remains ongoing but because the Company did not have the financial resources to see the legal action to conclusion it assigned the benefit, if any, from the suit to Christopher Diamantis for his assumption of the costs to carry the cost to conclusion.
In November of 2016, the IRS commenced an audit of the Company’s 2015 Federal tax return. Based upon the audit results and additional carryback adjustments, the Company made provisions of approximately $1.0 million as a liability and approximately $0.9 million as a receivable in its financial statements. During 2020, the Company received $0.6 million of income tax refunds. During the first quarter of 2020, the U.S. Congress approved the CARES Act, which allows a five-year carryback privilege for federal net operating tax losses that arose in a tax year beginning in 2018 and through the current tax year, that is, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 million in refunds from the carryback of certain of its federal net operating losses. Income taxes are more fully discussed in Note 15.
On September 27, 2016, a tax warrant was issued against the Company by the Florida Department of Revenue (the “DOR”) for unpaid 2014 state income taxes in the approximate amount of $0.9 million, including penalties and interest. The Company entered into a Stipulation Agreement with the DOR allowing the Company to make monthly installments until July 2019. The Company has made payments to reduce the amount owed. The Company intends to renegotiate another Stipulation agreement. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful. The balance accrued of approximately $0.4 million remained outstanding to the DOR at December 31, 2020.
In December of 2016, TCS-Florida, L.P. (“Tetra”), filed suit against the Company for failure to make the required payment under an equipment leasing contract that the Company had with Tetra and received a judgment against the Company. In May 2018, Tetra and the Company agreed to dispose of certain equipment and the proceeds from the sale were applied to the outstanding balance. In July 2020, the Company entered into a settlement with Tetra and paid $100,000 as full and final settlement of all liability to Tetra. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded a gain from settlement of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
In December of 2016, DeLage Landen Financial Services, Inc. (“DeLage”), filed suit against the Company for failure to make the required payments under an equipment leasing contract that the Company had with DeLage (see Note 11). On January 24, 2017, DeLage received a default judgment against the Company in the approximate amount of $1.0 million, representing the balance owed on the lease, as well as additional interest, penalties and fees. The Company recognized this amount in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016. On February 8, 2017, a Stay of Execution was filed and under its terms the balance due was to be paid in variable monthly installments through January of 2019, with an implicit interest rate of 4.97%. The Company and DeLage disposed of certain equipment and reduced the balance owed to DeLage. A balance of $0.2 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020.
On December 7, 2016, the holders of the Tegal Notes (see Note 8) filed suit against the Company seeking payment for the amounts due under the notes in the aggregate of the principal of $341,612, and accrued interest of $43,000. A request for entry of default judgment was filed on January 24, 2017. On April 23, 2018, the holders of the Tegal Notes received a judgment against the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has repaid $44,544 of the principal amount of these notes.
The Company, as well as many of our subsidiaries, are defendants in a case filed in Broward County Circuit Court by TCA Global Credit Master Fund, L.P. The plaintiff alleges a breach by Medytox Solutions, Inc. of its obligations under a debenture and claims damages of approximately $2,030,000 plus interest, costs and fees. The Company and the other subsidiaries are sued as alleged guarantors of the debenture. The complaint was filed on August 1, 2018. The Company has recorded the principal balance and interest owed under the debenture agreement for the period ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 8). The Company and all defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, but have not recorded any potential liability related to any further damages. In May 2020, the SEC appointed a Receiver to close down the TCA Global Master Fund, L.P. over allegations of accounting fraud. The amount recorded by the Company as being owed to TCA was based on TCA’s application of prior payments made by the Company. The Company believes that prior payments of principal and interest may have been applied to unenforceable investment banking and other fees and charges. It is the Company’s position that the amount owed to TCA is less than what is set forth in Note 8 and the Company intends to negotiate a settlement with the Receiver.
On September 13, 2018, Laboratory Corporation of America sued EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, in Palm Beach County Circuit Court for amounts claimed to be owed. The court awarded a judgment against EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. in May 2019 for approximately $155,000. The Company has recorded the amount owed as a liability as of December 31, 2020.
In August 2019, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. and Medytox Diagnostics, Inc. were sued by Beckman Coulter, Inc. in the same court under an agreement to purchase laboratory supplies. The plaintiff claims damages of approximately $124,000. The Company has disputed the amount owed, and in October 2020 entered into a settlement agreement to pay $35,000 as full and final settlement of this matter.
In July 2019, the landlord of Medytox Solutions, Inc. received a judgment in the amount of approximately $413,000 in connection with failure to pay under an office lease in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Company reached a settlement in May 2020 to resolve the judgment for the amount of $300,000, which was fully paid in 2020.
In February 2020, Anthony O. Killough sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, in New York State Court for the County of New York, for approximately $2.0 million relating to the promissory note issued by the Company in September 2019. In May 2020, the parties entered into a Stipulation providing for a payment of a total of $2,158,168 (which includes accrued interest) in installments through November 1, 2020 (See Note 8). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not made the majority of the required payments and, as a result, approximately $1.9 million, which includes penalty interest at a rate of 20% per annum, is due and owing.
In February 2021, a supplier to the Company’s hospitals, Shared Medical Services, Inc., filed suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court for approximately $90,000 by virtue of default and for breach of contract and charges totaling approximately another $100,000. The Company disputes that it has any liability or responsibility under the agreements and has filed an initial response in the matter.
Following the Company’s decision to suspend operations at Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2019 a number of vendors remain unpaid. A number have initiated or threatened legal actions. The Company believes it will come to satisfactory arrangements with these parties as it works toward reopening the hospital. The Company has accrued the amounts that it expects to owe in its financial statements. The Company is planning the reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans and timing thereof have also been disrupted by the current pandemic.
Two former employees of Jamestown Regional Medical Center have filed suit alleging violations of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (“WARN”). The Court entered a default against the Company on August 14, 2019. The parties disagreed to the amount of damages, specifically to whether part-time employees are entitled to WARN act damages. The parties have agreed and are in support of a confidential settlement agreement which is in the final stage of agreement and will be concluded in the second quarter of 2021. The Company has recorded the estimated settlement amount in the statements of operations in “Net gain from legal settlements,” and in the balance sheets in accrued expenses.
In June 2019, CHSPSC, the former owners of Jamestown Regional Medical Center, obtained a judgment against the Company in the amount of $592,650. The Company has recorded $130,000 of this judgment as a liability at December 31, 2020, as management believes that a number of insurance payments were made to CHSPCS after the change of ownership and will likely offset the majority of the claim made by CHSPCS.
In August 2019, Morrison Management Specialists, Inc. obtained a judgment against Jamestown Regional Medical Center and the Company in Fentress County, Tennessee in the amount of $194,455 in connection with housekeeping and dietary services. The Company has recorded this liability as of December 31, 2020.
In November 2019, Newstat, PLLC obtained a judgment against Big South Fork Medical Center in Knox County, Tennessee in the amount of $190,600 in connection with the provision of medical services. The Company has recorded this liability as of December 31, 2020.
Note 17 - Discontinued Operations
On July 12, 2017, the Company announced plans to spin off AMSG and in the third quarter 2017 our Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, HTS, as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. On June 10, 2020, the Company signed an agreement for the separation of these entities into a public company. The agreement with TPT Global Tech, Inc. (“TPT”) (OTC: TPTW), a California-based public company, was to merge HTS and AMSG into a public company after TPT completed a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary, InnovaQor, Inc., with this public company. Rennova terminated its agreement with TPT on March 8, 2021 after numerous attempts to close the transaction as proposed failed due to uncertainty and last minute unviable demands from TPT that would have created a high risk to the future success of the project. Rennova is currently considering the actions of TPT with the belief that TPT acted outside of agreements that were in place and may have converted Rennova owned confidential information for its own benefit. Rennova intends to pursue any remedy available to it under the law to recover money owed from TPT and to protect its technology and assets.
The Company continues to pursue options available to it to separate these entities and believes this can be accomplished in the second quarter of 2021. In accordance with ASC 205-20 and having met the criteria for “held for sale”, the Company has reflected amounts relating to AMSG and HTS (referred to below as the AMSG & HTS Group) as a disposal group classified as held for sale and included as part of discontinued operations.
During the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached a tentative agreement to sell its last clinical laboratory, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. to TPT and it made a decision to discontinue several other non-operating subsidiaries, and as a result, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations and the other non-operating subsidiaries have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The proposed sale of EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. was terminated by Rennova on March 10, 2021, along with a lab management agreement and other permissions that had been granted by Rennova to TPT. Rennova is owed certain payments under the agreements and intends to take the necessary actions to secure payments owed by TPT.
Carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale and included as part of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
AMSG & HTS Group Assets and Liabilities:
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. and Other Subsidiaries Assets and Liabilities
Consolidated Discontinued Operations Assets and Liabilities:
Major line items constituting loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
AMSG & HTS Group Loss from Discontinued Operations:
**Revenue from services, includes related party revenue of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. and Other Subsidiaries Loss from Discontinued Operations
(1)The Company recorded bad debts in excess of gross revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Note 18 - Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information
Note 19 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This standard will require entities to disclose the amount of total gains or losses for the period recognized in other comprehensive income that is attributable to fair value changes in assets and liabilities held as of the balance sheet date and categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. This ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. Under this standard customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The adoption of this new guidance prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This ASU will be effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning on December 31, 2020. Early adoption of this standard is permitted and may be applied either prospectively to eligible costs incurred on or after the date of the new guidance or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also simplifies areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes. This standard will be effective for us for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of this standard is permitted, including adoption of all amendments in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).The new guidance provides accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The FASB issued this Update to address issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The Board focused on amending the guidance on convertible instruments and the guidance on the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. This standard will be effective for us for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of this standard is not permitted for us because we have already adopted ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” We have not yet determined the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
Other recent accounting standards issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.
Note 20 - Subsequent Events
Conversions of Series N Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through March 31, 2021, the Company issued 435,082,000 shares of its common stock upon conversions of 4,177.52 shares of its Series N Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.2 million.
Potential Common Stock as of March 31, 2021
The following table presents the dilutive effect of our various potential common shares as of March 31, 2021:
On August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis entered into the Voting Agreement with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. This means that the holders of Series M Preferred Stock have sufficient votes, by themselves, to approve or defeat any proposal voted on by the Company’s stockholders, unless there is a supermajority required under applicable law or by agreement.
As a result of the Voting Agreement, as of the date of filing this report, the Company believes that it has the ability to ensure that it has and or can obtain sufficient authorized shares of its common stock to cover all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.
Jellico Community Hospital Closure
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. It is expected that Jellico’s property and equipment will be transferred to the Company’s other medical facilities. The value of its intangible asset, which was a certificate of need valued at $250,000, was recorded as an asset impairment in the year ended December 31, 2020. There may be other costs and expenses associated with the closure of Jellico and, if so determined, any such amounts will be recorded as charges/expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2021.
AMSG & HTS Group
On March 5 2021, Rennova terminated discussions with TPT to merge its AMSG & HTS Group into InnovaQor. The parties had worked for a number of months to close on an agreement that was previously announced but unfortunately could not reach final terms on a number of closing items. TPT has on March 23 2021 changed the name of InnovaQor, Inc. to TPT Strategic, Inc. Rennova continues to consider other options for the separation of this group and expects to complete a transaction in the second quarter of 2021 to have it separated and trade under the InnovaQor name.
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.
On March 10, 2021, Rennova terminated an agreement that it had entered into with TPT on August 6, 2020 for the purchase and sale of EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. The Company also terminated an Interim Management Agreement with TPT entered into on Aug 6, 2020 granting TPT an exclusive right and responsibility to undertake certain management and financial responsibility of EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., on our behalf and terminated all rights and approvals granted under letters dated November 2, 2020 and November 24, 2020 in reference to the Quicklab Application in partnership with EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.. Rennova intends to pursue whatever legal action necessary against TPT and TPT Medtech, LLC to recover money and damages owed from the breach of these agreements by TPT and to stop TPT from all activities that utilize or have been derived from their access to and use of Rennova owned confidential information.
Funding activities
On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into agreement with certain institutional investors for warrant prepayment promissory notes (the “February 25 Notes”) to the value of $550,000. The Company received proceeds of $500,000 from the Payees who may at their option apply all or any portion of the principle amount outstanding to the exercise of any common stock purchase warrants of the Company held by Payee. The February 25 Notes are unsecured and the maturity date of the February 25 Notes is twelve months from issuance. The February 25 Notes do not bear interest but an interest rate of 18% will be applied to the outstanding principle commencing 5 days after any event of default that results in the acceleration of the February 25 Notes.
On April 9 2021, the Company entered into agreement with certain institutional investors for warrant prepayment promissory notes (the “April 9 Notes”) to the value of $165,000. The Company received proceeds of $150,000 from the Payees who may at their option apply all or any portion of the principle amount outstanding to the exercise of any common stock purchase warrants of the Company held by Payee. The April 9 Notes are unsecured and the maturity date of the April 9 Notes is twelve months from issuance. The April 9 Notes do not bear interest but an interest rate of 18% will be applied to the outstanding principle commencing 5 days after any event of default that results in the acceleration of the April 9 Notes.

Item 9A.","Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the chief executive officer, who also functions as our interim chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2020. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2020 because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, presented below.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management, including the chief executive officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of the chief executive officer, who also functions as our interim chief financial officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In connection with such evaluation, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Insufficient staffing, accounting processes and procedures led to a lack of contemporaneous documentation supporting the accounting for certain transactions and the approval of certain cash disbursements. With the acquisitions of our hospitals, there are risks related to the timing and accuracy of the integration of information from various accounting systems whereby the Company has experienced delays in receiving information in a timely manner from its subsidiaries. Based on these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, management concluded the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company expects improvements to be made on the integration of information issues during 2021 as we plan to move towards securing a prompt and accurate reporting system. The Company is continuing to further remediate the material weaknesses identified above as its resources permit. The Company is in the process of taking the following steps to remediate these material weaknesses: (i) increasing the staffing of its internal accounting department; (ii) continuing the process of converting to a new integrated accounting system to enhance controls and procedures for recording accounting transactions; and (iii) implementing enhanced documentation procedures to be followed by the internal accounting department, including independent review of material cash disbursements.
Notwithstanding such material weakness, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods and dates presented.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended December 31, 2020, there was no material change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The following table provides information regarding outstanding equity awards held by the named executive officers at December 31, 2020:
AGREEMENTS WITH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Seamus Lagan
On October 1, 2012, Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) entered into a consulting agreement with Alcimede LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Lagan. This agreement replaced and superseded a previous Alcimede consulting agreement. This agreement was originally for three years, and is now subject to annual renewals thereafter, unless either party gives notice of non-renewal. The agreement provided for a retainer of $20,000 per month and reimbursement to Alcimede for its out of pocket expenses. The parties agreed to cancel the options issued pursuant to the prior agreement. Under the new agreement, Alcimede was issued 4,500,000 shares of common stock of Medytox and 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Medytox. In addition, Alcimede received options to purchase (i) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $2.50 per share through December 31, 2017, (ii) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $5.00 per share through December 31, 2017 and (iii) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $10.00 a share through December 31, 2022. On June 29, 2015, Alcimede exercised the option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The parties agreed to cancel the remaining options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share in connection with the merger of Medytox with the Company on November 2, 2015. The share amounts and exercise prices in this paragraph are on a pre-merger basis and do not reflect the reverse splits effected by the Company since the merger.
Effective September 11, 2014 and in conjunction with the appointment of Mr. Lagan as our Chief Executive Officer, such consulting agreement with Alcimede was amended to provide for a monthly retainer of $31,250, and we agreed to provide Mr. Lagan with an automobile.

On April 1, 2017, Alcimede agreed to a voluntary reduction in the monthly retainer to $20,833, which was increased back up to $31,250 in April 2018. In September 2020, it was agreed to pay $100,000 to renew the Alcimede consulting agreement for a three year period. It was further agreed that this consulting agreement could be assigned by to another entity and that termination of the agreement would trigger a $500,000 payment.
Director Compensation

(1) Based on 474,730,679 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and additional shares deemed to be outstanding as to a particular person, in accordance with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules to generally include shares of Common Stock subject to options or issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of warrants, and such shares are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person holding such options, securities or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person.
(2) Includes five shares of Common Stock and four stock options to purchase a like number of shares of Common Stock, owned of record by Mr. Lagan. Alcimede also owned 250,000 shares of Series L Preferred Stock, which were convertible into 44,483,985 shares of Common Stock on March 31, 2021. In addition, on August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock owned by Mr. Diamantis. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede owned, or had the right to vote, securities holding 55.19% of the total voting power of the Company’s voting securities. Because the conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock is determined based on the market price of the shares of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares are convertible, and the votes to which the Series L Preferred Stock is entitled, will fluctuate.
(3) Includes Messrs. Lagan, Blum and Langley. Includes five shares of Common Stock and four stock options to purchase a like number of shares of Common Stock owned by Messrs. Lagan, Blum and Langley, as described in the above footnotes.

Item 13.","Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Alcimede, of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager, billed the Company $0.4 million and $0.4 million for consulting fees and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to a consulting agreement for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, Mr. Lagan received a payment of $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 for renewal and amendment to the existing contract for a further three year period. On April 2, 2017, Alcimede agreed to a voluntary reduction in the monthly retainer payable by the Company from $31,250 to $20,833, which was increased back up to $31,250 on April 2018. On February 3, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.0 million from Alcimede. The note had an interest rate of 6% and was originally due on February 2, 2016. Alcimede later agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan to August 2, 2017. On June 29, 2015, Alcimede exercised options granted in October 2012 to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, and the loan outstanding was reduced in satisfaction of the aggregate exercise price of $2.5 million. In August of 2016, $0.3 million was repaid by the Company through the issuance of shares of common stock. In March of 2017, the Company and Mr. Lagan agreed that a payment made to Alcimede in the amount of $50,000 would be deducted from the outstanding balance of the note. On August 2, 2017, the Company and Alcimede agreed to further extend the maturity date of the loan to August 2, 2018. On July 20, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of its Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series J Preferred Stock”). On July 23, 2018, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Series J Agreement”) with Alcimede. Pursuant to the Series J Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of the Series J Preferred Stock in exchange for the cancellation of the outstanding principal and interest owed by the Company to Alcimede under the Note, dated February 5, 2015, and the cancellation of certain amounts owed by the Company to Alcimede under a consulting agreement between the parties. The total amount of consideration paid by Alcimede to the Company equaled $250,000. Each share of the Series J Preferred Stock had a stated value of $1.00 and was entitled to 8% per annum cumulative dividends at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. On September 27, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of its Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series K Preferred Stock”). On December 29, 2019, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Series K Agreement”) with Alcimede. Pursuant to the Series K Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of the Series K Preferred Stock in exchange for the 250,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock. The shares of Series J Preferred Stock were cancelled and, under the Series K Agreement, Alcimede relinquished all rights to any cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series K Preferred Stock did not provide for cumulative dividends. On May 4, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of Series L Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series L Preferred Stock”). On May 5, 2020, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Series L Agreement”) with Alcimede. Pursuant to the Series L Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of the Series L Preferred Stock in exchange for the 250,000 shares of Series K Preferred Stock. The shares of Series K Preferred Stock were cancelled. The Series L Preferred Stock was not convertible prior to December 1, 2020 (as compared to the Series K Preferred Stock which was convertible immediately) and the Series L Preferred Stock is not entitled to receive any dividends (unlike the Series K Preferred Stock, which was entitled to share in any dividends payable on the Common Stock).
Effective March 5, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. The purchase price was $658,537. The purchase price was made available by Mr. Diamantis, who was a director of the Company until his resignation on February 26, 2020.
On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to pledge certain of its accounts receivable as collateral against a prepaid forward purchase contract whereby the Company received consideration in the amount of $5.0 million. The receivables had an estimated collectable value of $8,700,000 and had been adjusted down to $0 as of December 31, 2017. In exchange for the consideration received, the counterparty received the right to: (i) a 20% per annum investment return from the Company on the consideration, with a minimum repayment term of six months and minimum return of $500,000, (ii) all payments recovered from the accounts receivable up to $5,250,000, if paid in full within six months, or $5,500,000, if not paid in full within six months, and (iii) 20% of all payments of the accounts receivable in excess of amounts received in (i) and (ii). On March 31, 2017, to the extent that the counterparty had not been paid $6,000,000, the Company was required to pay the difference. Mr. Diamantis guaranteed the Company’s payment obligation. On March 24, 2017, the Company, the counterparty and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, entered into an amendment to extend the Company’s obligation to March 31, 2018. Also, what the counterparty was to receive was amended to equal (a) the $5,000,000 purchase price plus a 20% per annum investment return thereon, plus (b) $500,000, plus (c) the product of (i) the proceeds received from the accounts receivable, minus the amount set forth in clauses (a) and (b), multiplied by (ii) 40%. In connection with the extension, the counterparty received a fee of $1,000,000. On April 2, 2018, the Company, the counterparty, and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, entered into a second amendment to extend further the Company’s obligation to May 30, 2018. In connection with this further extension, the counterparty received a fee of $100,000. The counterparty instituted an arbitration proceeding under the agreement with regard to the outstanding balance. In December 2018, the Company, Mr. Diamantis and the counterparty entered into a preliminary settlement agreement in connection with the arbitration, with the terms of the settlement agreement revised on March 31, 2019. The Company and Mr. Diamantis agreed to pay the counterparty $2,000,000 on or before April 5, 2019 and an additional $7,694,685 plus interest at 10% per annum on or before May 20, 2019, which date was subsequently amended. On April 5, 2019 and May 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis made payments totaling $5.0 million on behalf of the Company. The final payment of $4,937,105 was due on or before July 28, 2019. Mr. Diamantis made that payment on behalf of the Company on July 26, 2019. The Company and Mr. Diamantis have now complied with all of their obligations under the settlement agreement. As a result, the Company was obligated to repay Mr. Diamantis a total of $9,937,105.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Mr. Diamantis loaned the Company $7.6 million, the majority of which was used for working capital purposes, and the Company repaid Mr. Diamantis $4.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis advanced the Company $9.9 million, which was used for the settlement of the prepaid forward purchase contract discussed above, $0.7 million for the purchase of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center discussed above and $6.7 million that was used primarily for working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid Mr. Diamantis $2.3 million. On June 30, 2020, the Company exchanged the total amount owed to Mr. Diamantis on that date for outstanding loans and accrued interest, net of repayments, which was approximately $18.8 million, for shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock. The Series M Preferred Stock is more fully discussed below.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued interest of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, on the loans from Mr. Diamantis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued interest on the loans from Mr. Diamantis totaled $0.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Interest accrues on loans from Mr. Diamantis at a rate of 10% on the majority of the amounts loaned. In addition, the Company incurs interest expense related to the amounts Mr. Diamantis borrows from third-parties to loan to the Company.
On June 9, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of designation to authorize 30,000 shares of its Series M Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share. On June 30, 2020, the Company and Mr. Diamantis entered into an exchange agreement wherein Mr. Diamantis agreed to the extinguishment of the Company’s indebtedness to Mr. Diamantis totaling $18.8 million, including accrued interest, on that date in exchange for 22,000 shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. As a result of the exchange, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of approximately $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented the difference between the $18.8 million of debt and accrued interest exchanged and the value of the Series M Preferred Stock of $22.0 million
The terms of the Series M Preferred Stock were set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 16, 2020. In particular: (i) each holder of the Series M Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of the Company’s common stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. Each outstanding share of the Series M Preferred Stock shall represent its proportionate share of the 51% allocated to the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock in the aggregate. The Series M Preferred Stock shall vote with the common stock and any other voting securities as if they were a single class of securities; (ii) each share of the Series M Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 90% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the ten trading days immediately prior to the conversion date but in any event not less than the par value of the Company’s common stock; and (iii) dividends at the rate per annum of ten percent (10%) of the stated value per share shall accrue on each outstanding share of Series M Preferred Stock from and after the date of the original issuance of such share of Series M Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization). The dividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative and non-compounding; provided, however, that such dividend shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors and the Company shall be under no obligation to pay such dividends. No cash dividends shall be paid on the Company’s common stock unless the dividends are paid on the Series M Preferred Stock.
On August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock.
On September 27, 2019, the Company issued a promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $1.9 million, which was guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis. The payments due on November 8, 2019 and December 26, 2019 were not made and in February 2020 the lender sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis.
Director Independence
The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Gary L. Blum and Trevor Langley is an “independent director” under applicable rules. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director does not have a material relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires the Audit Committee to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has established a general pre-approval policy for certain audit and non-audit services, up to a specified amount for each identified service that may be provided by the independent auditors. The Chairman of the Audit Committee may specifically approve any service within the pre-approved audit and non-audit service category if the fees for such service exceed the maximum set forth in the policy, as long as the excess fees are not reasonably expected to exceed $50,000. Any such approval by the Chairman must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The general pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditors are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approved all services provided by Haynie during 2020 and 2019.

Overview
We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. Through our subsidiaries, 42West LLC (“42West”), The Door Marketing Group LLC (“The Door”), Shore Fire Media, Ltd (“Shore Fire”), Viewpoint Computer Animation, Inc. (“Viewpoint”) and Be Social Public Relations, LLC (“Be Social”), we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment, hospitality and music industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in the PR services for the industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides influencer marketing capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin’s legacy content production business, founded by our Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O’Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DLPN”.
Effective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split reducing the number of authorized shares from 200,000,000 to 40,000,000. All shares and per share amounts discussed in this Form 10-K have been retrospectively adjusted for the reverse stock split.
We currently operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment is composed of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic communications, social media marketing, creative branding, and the production of promotional video content. The content production segment is composed of Dolphin Films, Inc. (“Dolphin Films”) and Dolphin Digital Studios, which produce and distribute feature films and digital content.
With respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing segment, we currently see a favorable environment for organic growth. The original content budgets of many large studios and streaming services have grown considerably the past few years, and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the past 18 months have seen the entrance of large streaming services such as Disney+, Apple TV, Peacock (from NBCUniversal), HBO Max, Paramount+ and Discovery, all to compete with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. We believe that the foremost differentiating factor for all of these platforms will be original programming and, consequently, it is anticipated that there will be an increase of tens of billions of dollars in programming spent across the market. We also believe that each of these original shows will need substantial public relations and marketing campaigns to drive consumer awareness of both the shows themselves and the respective platforms on which to find them.
Additionally, we have endeavored to create a “marketing super group,” combining marketing, public relations, branding, and digital production, that will serve as a platform for organic growth via the cross-selling of services among our subsidiaries. By way of example, all of our public relations companies (42West, The Door and Shore Fire) have identified the ability to create content for clients as a “must have” for public relations campaigns in today’s environment, which relies so heavily on video clips to drive social media awareness and engagement. Thus, we believe that our acquisition of Viewpoint provides a critical competitive advantage in the acquisition of new clients in the entertainment and lifestyle marketing space, and has the potential to fuel topline revenue growth as the average revenue per client increases with the cross-selling of video content creation services. Furthermore, influencer marketing campaigns are considered essential to so many consumer product earned media campaigns in today’s online marketplace, creating large cross-selling opportunities from our PR agencies for Be Social’s expertise and services.
Finally, we believe that our expanding portfolio of public relations and marketing companies will continue to attract future acquisitions. We believe that our “marketing super group” is unique in the industry, as a collection of best-in-class service providers across a variety of entertainment and lifestyle verticals. We further believe that with each new acquisition in this space, our portfolio will increase its breadth and depth of services and, therefore, be able to offer an even more compelling opportunity for other industry leaders to join, and enjoy the benefits of cross-selling to a wide variety of existing and potential clients. Thus, we believe we can continue to grow both revenues and profits through future acquisitions into our entertainment publicity and marketing segment.
Growth Opportunities and Strategies
We are focused on driving growth through the following:
Expand and grow 42West to serve more clients with a broad array of interrelated services. We believe that the launch and growth of a large number of streaming services over the past 18 months represent tremendous organic growth opportunities for 42West, due to the increase in potential new clients and a larger number of individual projects to promote.
Enhanced by Dolphin’s acquisitions of Viewpoint and Be Social, 42West has the ability to both structure influencer marketing campaigns and create promotional and marketing content for clients, critical services for entertainment content marketers in today’s digital world.
We also believe that the skills and experience of our 42West business in entertainment PR are readily transferable to related business sectors, such as video games and e-sports. The growing involvement in non-entertainment businesses by many of our existing entertainment clients has allowed 42West to establish a presence and develop expertise outside its traditional footprint. Using this as a foundation, we are now working to expand our involvement in these new areas.
We also expect to continue to grow 42West’s current business divisions. For example:
·
In the Entertainment Marketing division, several of our large key clients have announced increased movie marketing budgets over the next several years that we expect will drive growth of our revenue and profits;
·
In the Talent division, we expect to continue to drive significant growth through the hiring of additional individuals or teams whose existing books of business and talent rosters can be accretive to revenues and profits of the business; and
·
In the Strategic Communications division, we believe that growth will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients over the next three to five years as they expand their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products sectors. We believe that this growth could result in the Strategic Communications division significantly increasing its contribution to revenue and profit, as this division typically generates higher profit margins than the other 42West divisions.
Expand and grow The Door through the expansion of Consumer Products PR business. The Door’s market-leading position in both the food and hospitality verticals, with many clients which have consumer-facing products and the need for attendant marketing campaigns, has provided the Company with the requisite experience for a successful entry into the high-margin consumer products PR business with potential clients outside of the food and hospitality verticals. We plan to significantly increase the number of consumer products PR accounts at The Door. Such accounts often generate higher monthly fees and longer-term engagements than any other customer vertical.
Expand and grow Shore Fire Media to serve more clients in more genres of music and in more markets. For over 30 years, Shore Fire has been a leader in providing public relations and marketing services to a broad array of songwriters, recording artists, publishers and others within the music industry, all from its headquarters in Brooklyn. We plan to significantly expand Shore Fire’s presence in other major music markets, including Los Angeles, Nashville and Miami, which we believe will provide access to potential clients across a wide array of popular musical genres, including pop, country and Latin.
Diversify Viewpoint’s Client Base. Viewpoint is a leading creative branding agency and promotional video content producer for the television industry, with long-term clients such as HBO, Discovery Networks, Showtime and AMC. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, Viewpoint can offer its best-in-class services to several new verticals, including motion picture production and distribution companies, musical artists, restaurant groups, the hospitality and travel industry and the marketers of consumer products. The ability for Viewpoint to reach clients of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire provides Viewpoint with the opportunity to diversify its client base, while allowing 42West, The Door and Shore Fire to increase their service offerings to, existing and future clients, potentially driving increased revenues.
Diversify Be Social’s Client Base. Be Social is a leading influencer marketing agency, with a specialization in the beauty, fashion and wellness industries. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, Be Social can offer its services to several new verticals, including motion picture and television content, podcasts, musical artists and labels, restaurant groups, hotels and resorts, the travel industry, the gaming and e-sports industry, and the marketers of broader consumer products. The ability for Be Social to reach clients of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire provides Be Social with the opportunity to diversify its client base, while allowing 42West, The Door and Shore Fire to increase their service offerings to, existing and future clients, potentially driving increased revenues.
Opportunistically grow through complementary acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions to further enhance our competitive advantages, scale our revenues, and increase our profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity services businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as live event production companies and PR firms in other entertainment verticals, can create synergistic opportunities that may increase profits and operating cash flow.
Build a portfolio of premium film, television and digital content. We intend to grow and diversify our portfolio of film, television and digital content by capitalizing on demand for high quality digital media and film content throughout the world marketplace. We plan to balance our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, we believe that marketing strategies that will be developed by 42West will drive our creative content, thus creating greater potential for profitability.
Given the events surrounding the global pandemic (COVID-19), we are evaluating the effects, both positive and negative, on our growth opportunities and strategies. As an example, The Door has been impacted since they operate in the hospitality industry but their consumer products division has grown. 42West has had additional opportunities in the streaming service marketing business as more films are released through these streaming services. Additionally, new acquisition opportunities may be available. We currently don’t have sufficient information to know any additional effects of the global pandemic but will continue to monitor the situation and take corrective action as necessary.
Entertainment Publicity and Marketing
42West
Through 42West, an entertainment public relations agency, we offer talent publicity, entertainment (motion picture and television) marketing and strategic communications services. Prior to its acquisition, 42West grew to become one of the largest independently-owned public relations firms in the entertainment industry, and in December 2019 (the most recent year of such rankings), 42West was ranked #4 in the annual rankings of the nation’s Power 50 PR firms by the New York Observer, the highest position held by an entertainment PR firm. As such, we believe that 42West has served, and will continue to serve, as an “acquisition magnet” for us to acquire new members of our marketing “super group,” which has the ability to provide synergistic new members with the opportunity to grow revenues and profits through 42West’s access, relationships and experience in the entertainment industry.
Our public relations and marketing professionals at 42West develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for dozens of movies and television shows annually, as well as for individual actors, filmmakers, recording artists, and authors.

We have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production if and when financing is obtained. We also own several other scripts that we may determine to produce as digital content if online distribution is secured.
Dolphin Digital Studios
Dolphin Digital Studios creates original content to premiere online.
Competition
The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, we compete against other public relations and marketing communications companies, as well as independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. Through Viewpoint and Be Social, we compete against other creative branding and influencer marketing agencies, as well as in-house teams at many of our clients. Our content production business faces competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. We are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies, as well as from large, well-established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
We believe that we compete on the basis of the following competitive strengths:
·
Market Reputations of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire- 42West, The Door and Shore Fire consistently rank among the most prestigious and powerful public relations firms in the United States (each ranking in the Top 50 Most Powerful PR Firms in the most recent ranking, as published by the New York Observer), which is a significant competitive advantage given the nature of the entertainment marketing and public relations industry, in which “perception is power;”
·
An Exceptional Management Team-our CEO, Mr. O’Dowd, has a 20-year history of producing and delivering high-quality family entertainment. In addition, 42West’s CEO, Amanda Lundberg, The Door’s CEO, Charlie Dougiello, and President, Lois O’Neill, and Shore Fire’s President Marilyn Laverty are all longtime PR practitioners, with decades of experience, and are widely regarded as being among the top communications strategists in the entertainment, hospitality and music industries, as evidenced by the market reputation of their companies; and
·
Our Ability to Offer Interrelated Services-we believe that our ability to offer influencer marketing expertise and creative branding opportunities for our 42West, The Door and Shore Fire clients, primarily through the services of Be Social and Viewpoint, will allow us to expand and grow our relationships with existing clients and also attract new ones.
·
Our Ability to Offer Services Across Multiple Verticals of Entertainment - we believe that our ability to offer relationship access and marketing reach across all of the film, television, podcast, music, celebrity chef, hospitality, gaming and e-sports industries will be attractive to marketers of consumer products who desire a broad campaign across pop culture, which will allow us to expand our client base and grow the size of our campaigns.
Employees
As of March 15, 2021, we had 163 full-time employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional employees on a project-by-project basis in connection with the production of digital media projects or motion pictures.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to state and federal work and safety laws and disclosure obligations, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state organizations.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements under Section 13(a) and Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. To the extent we are subject to these requirements, we will have our financial statements audited by an independent public accounting firm that is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and comply with Rule 8-03 or 10-01(d), as applicable, of Regulation S-X.

ITEM 1A.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Risks Related to our Business and Financial Condition
The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the global economy, the entertainment industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the extent of the continuing impact is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant operational volatility, uncertainty and disruption, both in the global economy, in general, and in the hospitality and entertainment industries, in particular. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted, including:
·
the duration and scope of the outbreak;
·
governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-at-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs;
·
the effectiveness and timing of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts;
·
the impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally;
·
the effect of the outbreak on our clients and other business partners;
·
our ability to access the capital markets and sources of liquidity on reasonable terms;
·
potential goodwill or other impairment charges;
·
our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our Term Loan agreement with Bank United;
·
increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions;
·
our ability during the outbreak to provide our services, including the health and wellbeing of our employees; and
·
the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the outbreak.
A continued slowdown in the economy has had, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on many of our clients. Some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, thereby decreasing the market and demand for some of our services. In addition, many businesses have adjusted, reduced or suspended operating activities, which has negatively impacted the markets we serve. All of the foregoing has and will continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and forward-looking expectations. The potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below, including as a result of, but not limited to, the factors listed above.
Our loans under the Paycheck Protection Program may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges and investigations regarding qualification for the loan.
Between April 19 and April 23, 2020, we and each of our subsidiaries, received five separate loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, referred to as the PPP Loans, which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.8 million. Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. Pursuant to Section 1106 of the CARES Act we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP Loans. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses, which include payroll costs, rent, and utility costs over the allowable measurement period following receipt of the loan proceeds. We have not yet submitted our application for forgiveness.
The SBA continues to develop and issue new and updated guidance regarding the PPP Loans application process, including guidance regarding required borrower certifications and requirements for forgiveness of loans made under the program. We continue to track the guidance as it is released and assess and re-assess various aspects of its application as necessary based on the guidance. However, given the evolving nature of the guidance and based on our projected ability to use the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses, we cannot give any assurance that the anticipated PPP Loans will be forgiven in whole or in part.
Our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions.
We are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets. Following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy continues to be challenging. Economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy in generally, or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors, and caution on the part of marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. In addition, market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters, public health crises, severe weather events, military conflict or civil unrest. Our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. In the past, including in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.
Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements included with this report are presented under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such as incurring substantial recurring net losses and losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.6 million, of which $0.7 million is a guaranty for certain leases and a working capital deficit of $3.0 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional capital to fund our operating expenses through loans and additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and, as a result, may not be able to continue as a going concern and could be forced to liquidate. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainties. Please also see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have a history of net losses and may continue to incur net losses.
We have a history of net losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, our net loss was $1,939,192 and $2,327,900. Our accumulated deficit was $97,972,041 and $97,158,766 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our ability to generate net profit in the future will depend on our ability to realize the financial benefits from the operations of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint, Be Social and to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series or films, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate net profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements. As a result, we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could substantially dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.
We currently have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations and may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
We currently have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. The table below sets forth our total principal amount of debt and stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Approximately $1.5 million of our total debt as of December 31, 2020 represented the fair value of the put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million represents PPP Loans received that we expect will be partially or fully forgiven. Approximately $3.0 million of our debt is related to convertible notes payable, $1.3 million to non-convertible notes payable and $0.9 million is a line of credit with Bank United.
Our indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:
·
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future productions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;
·
we may have to pay higher interest rates upon obtaining future financing, thereby reducing our cash flows; and
·
we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities.
Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance and our ability to obtain additional financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the profitability of our content production and entertainment publicity and marketing businesses and other factors contained in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control.
If we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying digital or film productions, delaying or abandoning potential acquisitions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
Our stock price has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.
Our stock price has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. For example, on March 22, 2021, the price of our common stock closed at $5.45 per share while on March 23, 2021, the price of our common stock closed at $18.33 after a press release announced the formation of our NFT division. Our volume on March 23, 2021 was 174,578,000 which was a substantial increase from the volume of 134,737 and 264,244 on the two days immediately preceding March 23, 2021. We may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may or may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by us. The stock market in general, and the market for entertainment companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:
·
announcements of state-of-the-art means of content production and entertainment publicity and marketing, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
·
announcements related to any delays in production or rollout of entertainment content;
·
our ability to meet or exceed the rapidly-changing expectations of our clients;
·
news that audience acceptance of and interest in our films and digital media productions, and therefore the commercial success of our content production business, is lower or higher than we expected;
·
our ability to adapt to rapid change in technology, forms of delivery, storage, and consumer preferences related to digital content;
·
announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us, our strategic collaboration partners or our competitors;
·
variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
·
trading volume of our common stock;
·
developments concerning our collaborations or partners;
·
the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on us;
·
the perception of the entertainment publicity and marketing or digital content production by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;
·
developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights;
·
significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;
·
our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;
·
sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;
·
declines in the market prices of stocks generally or of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; and
·
general economic, industry and market conditions.
In addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Capital Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Since the stock price of our common stock has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to liabilities.
We may in the future become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. We face litigation risks regarding a variety of issues, including without limitation, copyright infringement, allegations against clients or events we provide marketing services for, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, securities laws, and other matters. These proceedings may be time consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business. Costs we incur to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of these claims may not be covered by insurance or could exceed the amount of that coverage or increase our insurance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.
Our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls.
As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and we identified several material weaknesses. Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We have commenced our remediation efforts as discussed in Part II, 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures. If our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls occur in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weakness or deficiencies, harm our reputation and otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. In addition, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the “SEC” or the “Commission”).
We rely on information technology systems that are susceptible to cybersecurity risks. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.
We rely on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our businesses, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, films and digital programming and delivery of digital marketing services for our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. Power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information or other confidential information.
Likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. We also utilize third parties, including third-party “cloud” computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. Any such breaches or breakdowns could lead to business interruption, exposure of our or our clients’ proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Although we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to Our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing Business
Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain the principal sellers, and other key employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social and the clients they serve.
The success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business operated by 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social substantially depends on our ability to retain the services of the former owners and certain key employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan with respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing business and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we entered into employment agreements with each of the principal sellers, there can be no assurance that they will serve the terms of their respective employment agreements or choose to remain with us following the expiration of such terms. In addition, the employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. An important aspect of the business’ competitiveness is its ability to retain such key employees. If 42West, The Door, Shore Fire or Be Social fail to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees, it may have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.
42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social’s talent rosters currently include some of the best known and most highly respected members of the entertainment, hospitality, and musical communities. These include major studios and networks, corporations, well-known consumer brands, celebrity chefs, leading restaurant and hotel brands, recording artists and social media influencers. These clients often form highly loyal relationships with certain public relations and marketing professionals rather than with a particular firm. The employment agreements with the principal sellers currently contain non-competition provisions that prohibit the principal sellers from continuing to provide services to such clients should they leave our company, however, clients are free to engage other public relations and marketing professionals and there can be no assurance that they will choose to remain with our company. The success of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, therefore, depend on our ability to continue to successfully maintain such client relationships should the principal sellers or other key employees leave our company. If we are unable to retain the current 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social clients or attract new clients, then we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We operate in a highly competitive industry.
The entertainment publicity and marketing business is highly competitive. Through 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of marketing and publicity services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Through Viewpoint, we compete against other creative branding agencies, as well as in-house creative teams at many of our clients. The client’s perception of the quality of an agency’s creative work and the agency’s reputation are critical factors in determining its competitive position.
The success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business depends on its ability to consistently and effectively deliver marketing and public relations services to its clients.
42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social’s success depends on its ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements to achieve the clients’ unique personal or professional goals. 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, work to design customized communications or publicity campaigns tailored to the particular needs and objectives of particular projects. In some of its engagements, 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social rely on other third parties to provide some of the services to its clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social’s ability to provide its services. 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social’s failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate and execute its client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from clients, its reputation in the marketplace and ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.
If we are unable to adapt to changing client demands, social and cultural trends or emerging technologies, we may not remain competitive and our business, revenues and operating results could suffer.
We operate in an industry characterized by rapidly changing client expectations, marketing technologies, and social mores and cultural trends that impact our target audiences. The entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of message delivery and consumption emerge. These developments drive changes in our target audiences’ behavior to which we must adapt in order to reach our target audiences. In addition, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing social mores and cultural trends that impact the entertainment industry and our target audiences. We must adapt our business to these trends, as well as shifting patterns of content consumption and changing behaviors and preferences of our target audiences, through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit emerging technologies or if the marketing strategies we choose misinterpret cultural or social trends and prove to be incorrect or ineffective, any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.
A significant labor dispute in our clients’ industries could have a material adverse effect on our business.
An industry-wide strike or other job action by or affecting the Writers Guild, Screen Actors Guild or other major entertainment industry union could reduce the supply of original entertainment content, which would in turn reduce the demand for our talent and entertainment marketing services. An extensive work stoppage would affect feature film production as well as television and commercial production and could have a material adverse effect on our clients and the motion picture production industry in general. Contracts between entertainment industry unions and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which we refer to as AMPTP, expire from time to time. The failure to finalize and ratify a new agreement with the AMPTP or the failure to enter into new commercial contracts upon expiration of the current contracts could lead to a strike or other job action. Any such severe or prolonged work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the television and/or motion picture production industries and could severely impair our clients’ prospects. Any resulting decrease in demand for our talent and entertainment marketing and other public relations services would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
Clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.
As is customary in the industry, 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social’s agreements with their respective clients generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 days. Consequently, these clients may choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. If a significant number of the 42West, The Door, Shore Fire or Be Social clients were to reduce the volume of business they conducted with us or terminate their relationships with us completely, this could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. Viewpoint’s revenue is derived on a project-by-project basis. Clients may decide to use other creative branding and production companies for their projects which would have an adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.
Revenues from our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing segment are susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.
Economic downturns often severely affect the marketing services industry. Some of our corporate clients may respond to weak economic performance by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. In addition, economic downturns could lead to reduced public demand for varying forms of entertainment for which we are engaged to provide public relations and media strategy and promotional services. Such reduced demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
If our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results.
We have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions, such as the current events surrounding the COVID-19 global outbreak, could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. As an example, the temporary closure of restaurants and hotels due to the pandemic has adversely affected the revenues of our subsidiary, The Door. The direct impact on us included reduced revenues, write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and negatively impacted our operating cash flow.
Risks Related to Our Content Production Business
Our content production business requires a substantial investment of capital, and failure to access sufficient capital while awaiting delayed revenues will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.
The production, acquisition and distribution of film or digital media content require significant capital. The budget for the projects we intend to produce will each require between $6 and $8 million to produce. In addition, if a distributor does not provide the funds for the distribution and marketing of our film, we will require additional capital to distribute and market the film. We estimate that distribution and marketing fees will be approximately $10,000 per theatrical screen. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our productions. Our content production business does not have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution on which to depend for our liquidity needs, and a time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us as and when required, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our inability to raise capital necessary to sustain our operations while awaiting delayed revenues would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.
Our success is highly dependent on audience acceptance of our films and digital media productions, which is extremely difficult to predict and, therefore, inherently risky.
We cannot predict the economic success of any of our films because the revenue derived from the distribution of a film (which does not necessarily directly correlate with the production or distribution costs incurred) depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be accurately predicted. The economic success of a film also depends upon the public’s acceptance of competing films, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure-time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty.
The economic success of a film is largely determined by our ability to produce content and develop stories and characters that appeal to a broad audience and by the effective marketing of the film. The theatrical performance of a film is a key factor in predicting revenue from post-theatrical markets. If we are unable to accurately judge audience acceptance of our film content or to have the film effectively marketed, the commercial success of the film will be in doubt, which could result in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any particular feature film will generate enough revenue to offset its distribution, fulfillment services and marketing costs, in which case we would not receive any revenues for such film from our distributors.
In addition, changing consumer tastes affect our ability to predict which digital media productions will be popular with web audiences. As we invest in various digital projects, stars and directors, it is highly likely that at least some of the digital projects in which we invest will not appeal to our target audiences. If we are unable to produce web content that appeals to our target audiences, the costs of such digital media productions could exceed revenues generated and anticipated profits may not be realized. Our failure to realize anticipated profits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We have in the past and may, in the future, incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing, distribution and other costs.
We are required to amortize capitalized production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from our films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the capitalized production costs may be below their fair value. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual feature film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. For example, in 2016 and 2019, we recorded a $2 million and $0.6 million impairment, respectively, of the capitalized production costs for our feature film, Max Steel. In addition, certain GAAP guidance requires us to impair costs that have been capitalized for projects that are not set for production within three years of capitalizing the cost. In 2020 and 2019, we impaired the cost of several scripts based on this guidance. Such impairment charges have had, and in the future could have, a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our content production business is substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases and digital media productions, if any, in any given year and our inability to release any film or digital media productions or the unexpected delay or commercial failure of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.
Our content production business is currently substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases and digital media productions, if any, in any given year. The unexpected delay in release or commercial failure of just one of these films or digital media productions, or our inability to release any productions at all, could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in both the year of release and in the future. Historically, feature films that are successful in the domestic theatrical market are generally also successful in the international theatrical and ancillary markets, although each film is different and there is no way to guarantee such results. If our films fail to achieve domestic box office success, their success in the international box office and ancillary markets and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, we can make no assurances that the historical correlation between results in the domestic box office and results in the international box office and ancillary markets will continue in the future. If we are unable to release any film or digital media productions in a given year, or if the feature films we release do not perform well in the domestic or international theatrical markets and ancillary markets, or our digital media productions do not perform as anticipated, the failure to release any productions, or the failure of any one of the productions we release, could a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.
Delays, cost overruns, cancellation or abandonment of the completion or release of our web series or films may have an adverse effect on our business.
There are substantial financial risks relating to production, completion and release of web series and feature films. Actual costs may exceed their budgets due to factors such as labor disputes, unavailability of a star performer, equipment shortages, disputes with production teams or adverse weather conditions, any of which may cause cost overruns and delay or hamper film completion. We are typically responsible for paying all production costs in accordance with a budget and receive a fixed producer’s fee for our services plus a portion of any project income. However, to the extent that delays or cost overruns result in us not completing the web series or film within budget, there may not be enough funds left to pay us our producer’s fee, to generate any project income or complete the project at all. If this were to occur, it would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
We rely on third party distributors to distribute our films and their failure to perform or promote our films could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our films are primarily distributed and marketed by third party distributors. If any of these third-party distributors fails to perform under their respective arrangements, such failure could negatively impact the success of our films and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and ability to generate revenues.
We generally do not control the timing and manner in which our distributors distribute our films; their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote one of our films or to promote our competitors’ films or related products to a greater extent than they promote ours could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results. Additionally, because third parties are the principal distributors of our movies, the amount of revenue that is recognized from films in any given period is dependent on the timing, accuracy and sufficiency of the information received from our distributors. As is typical in the film industry, our distributors may make adjustments in future periods to information previously provided to us that could have a material impact on our operating results in later periods.
Our success depends on the services of our Chief Executive Officer.
Our success greatly depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. O’Dowd. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. O’Dowd. If Mr. O’Dowd resigns or becomes unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced, the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
The popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and feature films are subject to numerous factors, over which we may have limited or no control.
The popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and films depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the key talent involved, the timing of release, the promotion and marketing of the digital media production or film, the quality and acceptance of other competing productions released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, the genre and specific subject matter of the digital media production or film, its critical acclaim and the breadth, timing and format of its initial release. We cannot predict the impact of such factors on any digital media production or film, and many are factors that are beyond our control. As a result of these factors and many others, our digital media productions and films may not be as successful as we anticipate, and as a result, our results of operations may suffer.
The creation of content for the entertainment industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with companies with much greater resources than we have.
The business in which we engage is highly competitive. Our content production business operations are subject to competition from companies which, in many instances, have greater development, production and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the services of writers, producers, directors, actors and other artists to produce our digital media and motion picture content, as well as for advertisement dollars. Larger companies have a broader and more diverse selection of scripts than we do, which translates to a greater probability that they will be able to more closely fit the demands and interests of advertisers than we can.
As a small independent producer, we compete with major U.S. and international studios. Most of the major U.S. studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations that can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them better to offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and other operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties, as well as for actors, directors and other personnel required for production. Such competition for the industry’s talent and resources may negatively affect our ability to acquire, develop, produce, advertise and distribute digital media and motion picture content.
We must successfully respond to rapid technological changes and alternative forms of delivery or storage to remain competitive.
The entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of product delivery and storage, and certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these developments emerge. New technologies affect the demand for our content, the manner in which our content is distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings and the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view our content. We and our distributors must adapt our businesses to shifting patterns of content consumption and changing consumer behavior and preferences through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit these and other emerging technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.
We have in the past and may, in the future, be adversely affected by union activity.
We retain the services of actors who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which we refer to as SAG-AFTRA, and we may also become signatories to certain guilds such as Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. Collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. In addition, our digital projects fall within SAG-AFTRA’s definition of “new media”, which is an emerging category covered by its New Media and Interactive Media Agreements for actors. As such, our ability to retain actors is subject to uncertainties that arise from SAG-AFTRA’s administration of this relatively new category of collective bargaining agreements. Such uncertainties have resulted and may continue to result in delays in production of our digital projects.
In addition, if negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in production of our digital projects. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Depending on their duration, union activity or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Others may assert intellectual property infringement claims or liability claims for digital media or film content against us which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses.
There is a possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed web series, films, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. In addition, as distributors of digital media and film content, we may face potential liability for such claims as defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. If successfully asserted, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.
Our ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and distribution arrangements with companies for limited durations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Risks Related to Acquisitions
We are subject to risks associated with acquisitions and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.
We regularly undertake acquisitions that we believe will enhance our service offering to our clients. These transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. Our customary business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. Though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration. When actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all.
Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction. Our recent acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, including, without limitation:
·
diversion of management attention from managing our historical core business;
·
potential disruption of our historical core business or of the acquired business;
·
the strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;
·
inability to achieve synergies as planned;
·
challenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition;
·
dilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of equity securities;
·
becoming subject to adverse tax consequences or substantial depreciation;
·
difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures or in integrating systems and controls;
·
difficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors;
·
difficulties in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
·
inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs;
·
potential loss of key employees, key clients or other partners of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership; and
·
the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses.
If any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Any due diligence conducted by us in connection with potential future acquisition may not reveal all relevant considerations or liabilities of the target business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We conduct such due diligence with respect to our acquisitions as we deem reasonably practicable and appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify material issues and liabilities that may affect the decision to proceed with any one particular acquisition target or the consideration payable for an acquisition. We also use information revealed during the due diligence process to formulate our business and operational planning for, and our valuation of, any target company or business. While conducting due diligence and assessing a potential acquisition, we may rely on publicly available information, if any, information provided by the relevant target company to the extent such company is willing or able to provide such information and, in some circumstances, third party investigations.
There can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken with respect to an acquisition, will reveal all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisition including the determination of the price we may pay for an acquisition target or to formulate a business strategy. Furthermore, the information provided during due diligence may be incomplete, inadequate or inaccurate. As part of the due diligence process, we will also make subjective judgments regarding the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of a potential target. Our due diligence investigation of a particular acquisition target may not uncover all material issues and liabilities to which we may become subject. If our due diligence investigation fails to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present in a target company or business, or if we consider such material risks to be commercially acceptable relative to the opportunity, and we proceed with an acquisition, we may subsequently incur substantial impairment charges or other losses.
In addition, following an acquisition, including those already completed, we may be subject to significant, previously undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business that were not identified during due diligence. Any such liabilities could contribute to poor operational performance, undermine any attempt to restructure the acquired company or business in line with our business plan and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Losses incurred by us subsequent to completion of an acquisition may not be indemnifiable by the seller or may exceed the seller’s indemnification obligations.
As discussed above, there may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally will have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition agreement, these obligations are usually subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any losses that we incur with respect to a particular acquisition. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
We have recognized a goodwill impairment in the past and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.
We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Events or changes indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include reduced future cash flow estimates, slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate and a decline in our stock price and market capitalization. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $1.9 million in charges for the impairment of goodwill for 42West based on a reduced cash flow estimate.
Risks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock
We have recently issued, and may in the future issue, a significant amount of equity securities and, as a result, your ownership interest in our company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted and your investment in our common stock could suffer a material decline in value (All shares and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the 1:5 reverse stock split effectuated on November 27, 2020).
From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding has increased from 2,823,547 to 6,618,785 shares. During this period, we issued approximately 417,685 shares of our common stock as consideration for 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social acquisitions. On August 14, 2019 we exchanged 8,948 put rights held by one of the sellers of 42West for 77,103 shares of common stock. We will issue 5,364 shares of our common stock for the working capital adjustment to the sellers of The Door. Furthermore, we may issue up to 307,692 shares of our common stock to the sellers of The Door if the applicable earn out financial target is achieved in the during 2021. We will issue to the Shore Fire seller the equivalent of $200,000 of our common stock at the trading stock price on second anniversary of the acquisition of Shore Fire and will issue to the Be Social seller the equivalent of $350,000 of our common stock based on the 30-day trading average on January 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, certain holders of convertible notes exercised their right to convert all or a portion of their convertible notes and we issued 1,208,955 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding a convertible note payable that as of the date of this report is still outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000, which is convertible into 128,205 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had convertible notes payable in the amount of $2,545,000 that were converted subsequent to year end into 663,155 shares of our common stock. On June 9, 2020, we issued 1,580,000 shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering at a purchase price of $5.25 per share. As a result of these past issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted.
The market price for our common stock has been volatile, and these issuances could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially. Once restricted stock issued in either private placements or to the sellers of the companies we acquired becomes freely tradable, these shareholders may decide to sell their shares of common stock and, if our stock is thinly traded, this could have a material adverse effect on its market price.
We may need to raise additional capital and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or debt securities, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuances of additional securities would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may further exacerbate any or all of the above risks.
The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has super voting rights that may adversely affect our shareholders.
The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is held by Dolphin Entertainment LLC, an entity owned by Mr. O’Dowd. Except as required by law, holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will only have voting rights once the independent directors of the Board determine that an optional conversion threshold (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designation) has occurred. On November 12, 2020, such determination by the Board was made, and the holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (indirectly Mr. O’Dowd) is entitled to super voting rights of three votes for each share of common stock into which such holder’s shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted. As of December 31, 2020, the Series C Preferred Stock could be converted into 3,806,188 shares of our common stock and the holder was entitled to 11,418,565 votes, which is approximately 63% of our voting securities. The holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters upon which common stockholders are entitled to vote. Your voting rights will be diluted as a result of these super voting rights. On November 12, 2020, we entered into a stock restriction agreement with Mr. O’Dowd that prohibits the conversion of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock unless the majority of the independent directors of the board of directors vote to remove the restriction. The stock restriction agreement will be immediately terminated upon a change of control as defined in the agreement
If we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, our stock could be delisted, and the trading price, volume and marketability of our stock could be adversely affected.
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We cannot assure you, that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s current listing standards, or that Nasdaq will not implement additional listing standards with which we will be unable to comply. On October 17, 2019, we received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq informing us that our common stock failed to comply with the $1 minimum bid price required for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based upon the closing bid price of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice from Nasdaq. Nasdaq normally provides an initial cure period of six months. Due to the market conditions in 2020, Nasdaq determined to toll the compliance period for the minimum bid price through June 30, 2020. As a result, we were required to regain compliance by December 28, 2020. To regain compliance, the minimum bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive days at any point prior to December 28, 2020. On November 27, 2020, we effectuated a 1-to-5 reverse stock split and after ten consecutive days with a minimum bid price of at least $1.00, Nasdaq notified us that we were in compliance with the minimum bid price listing requirement.
Failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements could result in the delisting of our shares from Nasdaq, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, volume and marketability of our common stock. Furthermore, a delisting could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future or result in a loss of confidence by investors or employees.
Accounting for the put rights and contingent consideration could cause variability in the results we report. (All share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the 1:5 reverse stock split effectuated on November 27, 2020)
In connection with the 42West acquisition, we granted put rights to the sellers to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 237,419 (including the shares from the earn out consideration) of their shares of common stock received as consideration for a purchase price equal to $46.10 per share during certain specified exercise periods set forth in the put agreements up until December 2020. The sellers of 42West agreed to extend the expiration of the put rights through March 31, 2021. As of the date of this report, the sellers have exercised an aggregate of 218,440 shares of common stock pursuant to the put rights. We have also purchased 24,090 shares of common stock and may purchase up to an additional 4,050 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $46.10, from certain 42West employees with change of control provisions in their employment agreements, who received shares of our common stock at the time of the 42West acquisition and will receive additional shares in 2021 related to the earn out consideration. The sellers of The Door may also earn up to 307,692 and shares of common stock if certain financial targets are achieved over a four-year period. The seller of Be Social may earn up to the equivalent of $300,000 of our common stock using a 30-day trading trailing average upon achievement of certain financial targets through December 31, 2023. The put rights and contingent consideration are embedded derivatives within our common stock requiring certain fair value measurements at each reporting period. We record the fair value of the put right liability and the contingent consideration liability in the consolidated balance sheets and we record changes to the liability against earnings or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The put rights and contingent consideration are inherently difficult to value. We could have substantial variability in the related periodic fair value measurements, which would affect our operating results and in turn could impact our stock price.

OVERVIEW
We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DLPN”.
On August 17, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social Public Relations, LLC, a California LLC referred to as Be Social. Be Social is a Los Angeles based digital communications group representing both brands and highly-engaged digital influencers. As consideration for the acquisition of the membership interest of Be Social we agreed to pay to the seller, Ms. Alison Grant, (i) $1.5 million in cash and 69,907 shares of our common stock on August 17, 2020 and (ii) issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $350,000 on January 4, 2021. We may also pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Ms. Grant has entered into an employment agreement with a term through December 31, 2023.
Through our subsidiaries 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in PR services for the respective industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides digital communication capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin’s legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O’Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
We have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2021, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2021 or at all.
We operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment comprises 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic marketing consulting, digital marketing capabilities, creative branding and in-house production of content for marketing. The content production segment comprises Dolphin Films and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.
On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected our business and demand for certain of our services. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector that has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients have been negatively impacted by the suspension or reduction of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. We have taken steps to align our expenses with our changes in revenue. The steps being taken across the Company include freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending. We continue to believe that our strategic strengths discussed above will continue to assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.
Effective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split. Shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the following management discussion and analysis.
Going Concern
Management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our accumulated deficit, recurring losses and working capital deficit, as of December 31, 2020. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In addition, we operate in industries that have been adversely affected by COVID-19 (e.g. food, hospitality and talent PR). On June 5, 2020, we sold 1.6 million shares and received proceeds in the amount of approximately $7.6 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, as well as available bank and non-bank financing, or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital or securing loans. Any such issuances of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. In April of 2020, we received five separate loans for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169, prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Payroll Protection Program. There is no assurance that our loans will be forgiven. If we are unable to raise additional funds from the sale of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, bank and non-bank financing or any combination of such financing securities, we may not be able to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
REVENUES
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived substantially all of our revenues from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment derives its revenues from providing public relations services for celebrities and musicians, entertainment and targeted content marketing for film and television series, strategic communications services for corporations and public relations, marketing services and brand strategies for hotels and restaurants. We additionally derived revenues from the content production segment primarily from the distribution of our feature films, Max Steel and Believe. The table below sets forth the percentage of total revenue derived from our two segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Entertainment Publicity and Marketing
Our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. We believe that we have a stable client base, and we have continued to grow organically through referrals and actively soliciting new business, as well as through acquisition of new businesses within the same industry. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.
We earn entertainment publicity and marketing revenues primarily through the following:
·
Talent - We earn fees from creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including Oscar, Tony and Emmy winning film, theater and television stars, directors, producers, celebrity chefs and Grammy winning recording artists. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio and/or network liaison work, and event and tour support.
·
Entertainment Marketing and Brand Strategy- We earn fees from providing marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for entertainment content (including theatrical films, television programs, DVD and VOD releases, and online series) from all the major studios, as well as content producers ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. In addition, we provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, food and wine festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red-carpet management. As part of our services, we offer marketing and publicity services tailored to reach diverse audiences. We also provide marketing direction targeted to the ideal consumer through a creative public relations and creative brand strategy for hotel and restaurant groups. Our clients for this type of service include major studios, streaming services, independent producers and leading hotel and restaurant groups. We expect that increased digital streaming marketing budgets at several large key clients will drive growth of revenue and profit in 42West’s Entertainment Marketing division over the next several years.
·
Strategic Communications - We earn fees by advising companies looking to create, raise or reposition their public profiles, primarily in the entertainment industry. We believe that growth in Strategic Communications division will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients who are expanding their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products PR sectors. We expect that this growth trend will continue for the next three to five years. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies, as well as high-profile individuals address sensitive situations.
·
Creative Branding and Production - We offer clients creative branding and production services from concept creation to final delivery. Our services include brand strategy, concept and creative development, design and art direction, script and copyrighting, live action production and photography, digital development, video editing and composite, animation, audio mixing and engineering, project management and technical support. We expect that our ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries, will be accretive to our revenue.
·
Digital Media Influencer Marketing Campaigns - We arrange strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers, for both organic and paid campaigns. We also offer services for social media activations at events, as well as editorial work on behalf of brand clients. Our services extend beyond our own captive influencer network, and we manage custom campaigns targeting specific demographics and locations, from ideation to delivery of results reports. We expect that our relationship with social media influencers will provide us the ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries and will be accretive to our revenue.
Content Production
Project Development and Related Services
We have a team that dedicates a portion of its time to identifying scripts, story treatments and novels for acquisition, development and production. The scripts can be for either digital or motion picture productions. We have acquired the rights to certain scripts that we intend to produce and release in the future, subject to obtaining financing. We have not yet determined if these projects would be produced for digital, television or theatrical distribution.
Our pipeline of feature films includes:
·
Youngblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic and;
·
Sisters Before Misters, a comedy about two estranged sisters finding their way back to each other after a misunderstanding causes one of them to have to plan the other’s wedding.
·
Out of their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband versus wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and
We have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production once financing is obtained. We are planning to fund these projects through third-party financing arrangements, domestic distribution advances, pre-sales, and location-based tax credits, and if necessary, sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to produce any of these feature films.
EXPENSES
Our expenses consist primarily of: (1) direct costs; (2) selling, general and administrative expenses; (3) depreciation and amortization expense; (4) legal and professional fees and (5) payroll expenses.
Direct costs include certain cost of services, as well as certain production costs, related to our entertainment publicity and marketing business. Included within direct costs are immaterial impairments for any of our content production projects.
Selling, general and administrative expenses include all overhead costs except for payroll, depreciation and amortization and legal and professional fees that are reported as a separate expense item.
Depreciation and amortization include the depreciation of our property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and leasehold improvements.
Legal and professional fees include fees paid to our attorneys, fees for investor relations consultants, audit and accounting fees and fees for general business consultants.
Payroll expenses include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits.
Other Income and Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other income and expenses consisted primarily of: (1) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (2) acquisition costs; (3) changes in the fair value of put rights; (4) changes in fair value of contingent consideration; (5) changes in fair value of warrants; (6) changes in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities and (7) interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also had a loss on the deconsolidation of our Max Steel variable interest entity.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were as follows:
Revenues from entertainment publicity and marketing decreased by approximately $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease a result of COVID-19 and its effects on food and hospitality sector and the talent division. Government imposed orders to either reduce or completely shut down the in-restaurant service has caused our clients to either reduce or suspend the services we offer. As the production of content was halted between mid-March 2020 and July 2020, several of our talent clients requested to suspend their services during this period until the recommencement of production.
Revenues from content production increased by $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Revenues for the content production segment are currently derived from either Max Steel or Believe, feature films that were released in 2016 and 2013, respectively, and our nearing the end of their normal revenue cycles.
On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender of the prints and advertising loan and agreed to give them up $0.9 million of future domestic distribution revenue in exchange for the payment and full satisfaction of the prints and advertising loan in the amount of $0.7 million, including accrued interest, on the date of the agreement. We do not expect to receive any significant future revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel.
Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating expenses were as follows:
Overall expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is related to the changes described below.
Direct costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct costs for Viewpoint are primarily costs attributable to the production costs of each of their projects. The decrease in direct costs is primarily related to a decrease in Viewpoint’s revenue due to COVID-19, as well as reduced direct client costs at 42West and The Door from a slowdown in business from COVID-19.
Direct costs attributable to the content production segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.05 million, mainly attributable to the impairment of script costs. Direct costs related to the content production segment were approximately $0.8 million for 2019. During 2019, direct costs for the content production segment consisted primarily of impairment of capitalized production for Max Steel as a result of the agreement to direct all future domestic film revenues up to $0.9 million to the print and advertising loan’s creditor, in settlement of said loan. We evaluate capitalized production costs to determine if the fair value of the capitalized production costs is below the carrying value. Based on management’s estimate of ultimate revenues for Max Steel, the capitalized production costs in the amount of $0.6 million were determined to be above fair value and were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses for Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and four months of selling, general and administrative expenses for Be Social acquired in August 2020.
Depreciation and amortization had an immaterial increase of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to the amortization of intangible assets of Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and Be Social acquired in August 2020.
Legal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in audit fees and certain legal fees.
Payroll expenses decreased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In response to the business slowdown due to COVID-19, the certain staff salaries were reduced during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of Shore Fire and Be Social payroll expense.
Other Income and Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million primarily related to the Max Steel VIE. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the production service agreement confirmed that the Max Steel VIE did not owe them any debt. We reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE. As a result, we deconsolidated the Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of approximately $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14-(Variable Interest Entities) to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our analysis of primary beneficiary status.
As previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed to exchange up to $0.9 million of future domestic revenues of Max Steel for the extinguishment of the prints and advertising loan and recorded $0.7 million of a gain on the extinguishment of that debt.
Acquisition costs consisted primarily of legal, consulting and auditing costs related to our acquisitions. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of Be Social in August 2020. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of costs associated with our acquisition of Shore Fire in December 2019.
The fair value of put rights related to the 42West acquisition were recorded on our balance sheet on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the put rights is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the puts was $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of The Door and Be Social were recorded on our balance sheet on July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent consideration is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss of $0.06 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a gain of approximately $0.2 million and was related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for The Door.
We elected the fair value option for certain convertible notes issued in 2020. The embedded conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note meets the criteria for a derivative. The fair value of these notes and embedded conversion feature are remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature of $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net income.
Warrants issued with each of the 2019 and 2020 Lincoln Park convertible notes payable and Series “I” warrant were each initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of these warrants increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest expense and debt amortization decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to convertible promissory notes that were converted into shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion on these notes payable.
Income Tax Benefit
We had an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary component of the income tax benefit in both years is due to a release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities of the companies acquired.
As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $46.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, we have approximately $26.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14.9 million of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3.9 million, approximately $4.3 million of New York state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038, approximately $3.9 million of New York city net operating loss carryforwards that being to expire in 2038, approximately $0.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031, and approximately $1.3 million of Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.
In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we have accordingly recorded a net valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net Loss
Net loss was approximately $(1.9) million or $(0.35) per share based on 5,619,969 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(0.58) per share based on 6,382,937 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net loss was approximately $(2.3) million or $(0.70) per share based on 3,304,585 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(1.20) per share based on 4,285,101 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the factors discussed above.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.5 million. Our net loss of approximately $1.9 million contained non-cash items such as gain on extinguishment of debt and changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $1.3 million resulting in $0.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, primarily from the increase of accounts receivable for projects completed by The Door and Viewpoint at year end. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.9 million. Our net loss of approximately $2.3 million contained non-cash items such as changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $0.3 million resulting in $2.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $0.3 million.
Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million primarily related to (i) a payment of deferred cash consideration for the Shore Fire acquisition in the amount of $0.3 million, (ii) a payment of approximately $1.0 million, net of cash acquired for the Be Social acquisition and $0.08 for fixed assets purchased. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $0.9 million and were primarily related to approximately $0.8 million for the purchase of Shore Fire, net of cash acquired and approximately $0.1 million for the purchase of fixed assets.
Cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $8.6 million as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of the net of (i) $0.5 million to paydown the line of credit with Bank United; (ii) $0.3 million of principal and interest payments for the term loan with Bank United; (iii) $1.6 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iv) $0.3 million comprising the final installment of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (v) $1.9 million to repay convertible notes that matured, including $0.7 million to a related party, Leslee Dart, a member of the Board of Directors; (vi) $0.8 million consideration paid in installments as deferred cash consideration to the seller of Shore Fire; (vii) $7.6 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a registered direct offering in June of 2020 and (viii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3.6 million.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash available for working capital of approximately $7.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, not including $0.7 million pledged as collateral for standby letter of credit for the New York office, and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
Our net losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, along with an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.0 million as of December 31, 2020, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2020 Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Such issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. We currently have the rights to several scripts, that we intend to produce and release subject to obtaining financing. We will potentially earn a producer and overhead fee for this production. There can be no assurances that such production will be released or fees will be realized in future periods.
Our subsidiaries operate in industries that were adversely affected by the government mandated shelter-in-place, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we entered into five separate loan agreements and received an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no assurance that our obligation under these loans will be forgiven.
In addition, we have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $10.9 million and our total stockholders’ equity was approximately $19.7 million. Approximately $1.5 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 represents the fair value of put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 is related to PPP Loans received that may be forgiven upon application to the lender for qualifying expenditures primarily related to payroll costs.
If we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
Financing Arrangements
Prints and Advertising Loan
On August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, or Max Steel Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the P&A Loan, providing for a $14.5 million non-revolving credit facility that matured on August 25, 2017. The loan was not guaranteed by any other Dolphin entity and the only asset held by Max Steel Holdings is the copyright for the motion picture. The loan was also secured by $1,250,000 in a deposit account and a third-party guarantee of $4,500,000, of which Dolphin agreed to backstop $620,000. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay a portion of the P&A expenses of the domestic distribution of our feature film, Max Steel. During 2017 the lender applied the $1,250,000 in the deposit account and the third-party guarantor paid the $4,500,000 to reduce the loan balance. Repayment of the loan was intended to be made from revenues generated by Max Steel in the United States. Max Steel did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan prior to the maturity date. On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender whereby they are entitled to the next $0.9 million of revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel in exchange for payment and satisfaction in full of the P&A Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million related to this revenue participation agreement.
Production Service Agreement
During 2014, the Max Steel variable interest entity (or Max Steel VIE), created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel, entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $10.4 million to produce Max Steel. The loan was partially secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The agreement contained repayment milestones to be made during 2015, which were not met and, as such, accrued interest at a default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited until the maturity date of January 31, 2016 or the release of the movie. Due to delays in the release of the film, Max Steel VIE was unable to make some of the scheduled payments and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Max Steel VIE accrued $1.6 million of interest at the default rate. The film was released in theaters in the United States on October 14, 2016 and delivery to the international distributors began after the US release. On February 20, 2020, the Company received notification from the lender of the Production Service Agreement that the Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt to the lender. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3.3 million during year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a balance of $0 and $3.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets related to the Production Service Agreement.
42West Line of Credit
On March 15, 2018, 42West entered into a business loan agreement with BankUnited, N.A., (the “Loan Agreement”), for a revolving line of credit agreement under a revolving note. The revolving line of credit matured on March 15, 2020 and bore interest on the outstanding balance at the bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% per annum. The maximum amount that could be drawn on the revolving line of credit was $2,300,000. Amounts outstanding under the note were secured by 42West’s current and future inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles. On March 28, 2018, we drew $1,690,000 from the line of credit facility to purchase 36,659 shares of our common stock, per the put agreements with the sellers of 42West. On February 20, 2020, in anticipation of converting the line of credit into a term loan, we partially repaid the line of credit in the amount of $500,000. On March 31, 2020 we converted the line of credit into a three-year term loan in the amount of $1,200,390. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the loan recorded on our balance sheet was $1,700,390.
Term Loan
On March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender’s Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the balance on the term loan was $900,292.
The Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door’s insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our calculations, we believe we are out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we have classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

On June 15, 2020, $250,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt and $2,905 of accrued interest was converted into 84,302 shares of our common stock; on June 17, 2020, $75,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt and $333 of accrued interest was converted into 24,802 shares of our common stock; on June 30, 2020, $50,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt was converted into 15,873 shares of our common stock and on July 1, 2020, two notes in the aggregate amount of $100,000 were converted into 32,002 shares of our common stock, using a 90-day average trading price. We recorded as debt amortization a beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Debt in the aggregate amount of $550,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have an outstanding balance for any of the 2017 convertible debt. During 2020, we paid interest in the amount of $29,154, recorded interest expense in the amount of $24,917 and recorded as debt amortization a beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Debt in the aggregate amount of $550,000 on our consolidated statement of operations.
2020 Registered Direct Offering
On June 5, 2020, we issued and sold to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.25 per share. The offering of the shares was made pursuant to our then effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received proceeds of approximately $7.6 million from the issuance and sale of our common stock after deducting related offering fees and expenses.
2019 Public Offering
On October 21, 2019, in an underwritten registered public offering, we sold 540,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.91 per share. The net proceeds of the 2019 Public Offering were approximately $1.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or “GAAP”. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we have made appropriate accounting estimates on certain accounting matters, which include the allowance for doubtful accounts, carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets, based on the facts and circumstances available to us as of the reporting date. Our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our financial statements in future reporting periods.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2020, in connection with its acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social, we have a balance of $19,627,856 of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which management has assigned to the entertainment publicity and marketing segment. This amount includes a provisional goodwill balance of $1,555,030 related to the Be Social acquisition and a working capital adjustment in the amount of $124,836 pursuant to the Shore Fire purchase agreement that were each made during the year ended December 31, 2020. We account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We evaluate goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, including goodwill. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, we conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its’ carrying value (including goodwill). We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying value, a goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recorded.
We determined that the adverse effects of COVID-19 on certain of the industries in which we operate could be an indicator of a possible impairment of goodwill. As such, we updated our estimates and assumptions, with the information available as of the date of the assessment, performed an impairment test on the carrying value of our goodwill and determined that an impairment adjustment was not necessary. As previously discussed, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. Our future assessment of the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business could result in impairment of goodwill in future reporting periods.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires all assets and liabilities arising from leases to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB added an optional transition method which we elected upon adoption of the new standard. This allowed us to recognize and measure leases existing at January 1, 2019 without restating comparative information. In addition, we elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at the lease commencement date. In addition to our lease agreements, we review all material new vendor arrangements for potential embedded lease obligations. The asset balance related to operating leases is presented within “right-of-use (ROU) asset” on our consolidated balance sheet. The current and noncurrent balances related to operating leases are presented as “Lease liability”, in their respective classifications, on our consolidated balance sheet.
The lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for the leases in existence on the date of adoption or our incremental borrowing rate on the date of the lease for leases entered into after January 1, 2019. The ROU asset is calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date (i.e. prepaid rent) and initial direct costs incurred by us and excluding any lease incentives received from the Lessor. For operating leases, the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for its lease and non-lease components as a single component, and therefore both are included in the calculation of lease liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Applying this guidance, we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.
Revenue from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment consists of fees from the performance of professional services and billings for direct costs reimbursed by clients. Fees are generally recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis, as the services are consumed by our clients, which approximates the proportional performance on such contracts. Direct costs reimbursed by clients are billed as pass-through revenue with no mark-up. We enter into contracts that provide for third-party costs. We typically act as an agent in these types of arrangements and recognize the revenue only on the fees attributable to our performance of the contract and not including the third-party costs which are not recorded on our consolidated statement of operations. Revenues from content produced for digital marketing is recognized upon satisfactory delivery to the client. We also enter into management agreements with a roster of social media influencers and are paid a percentage of the revenue earned by the social media influencer. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, the performance obligation is typically completed and revenue is recognized in the period in which the contract originated.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of our company. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, defined as follows:
Level 1
-
Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2
-
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
Level 3
-
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as of the reporting date.
We carry certain derivative financial instruments using inputs classified as “Level 3” in the fair value hierarchy on our balance sheets.
Convertible Notes and Warrants
The 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants, the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants and the Series “I” Warrant were each determined to be a derivative liability under FASB ASC 815. Each are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet. They were each initially measured at fair value at time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as other income or expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes simulation valuation model. The model utilized our common stock price and certain Level 3 inputs to take into account the probabilities of certain events occurring over their respective life.
We account for the issued and outstanding 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes under the “Fair Value Option election” of ASC 825, Financial Instruments, as discussed below. The notes are each a debt financial instrument host containing embedded features and /or options which would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815. Notwithstanding, ASC 825-10-15-4 provides for the “fair value option” (“FVO”), to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825-10-15-5, to be afforded to financial instruments, wherein the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. Further, the estimated fair value adjustment, as required by ASC 825-10-45-5, is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with respect to the portion of the fair value adjustment attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, with the remaining amount of the fair value adjustment recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. With respect to our 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes, the “other income (expense) component” is presented in a single line in the consolidated statement of operations within net income, as none of the change in fair value was attributable to instrument specific credit risk. See our accompanying consolidated financial statements Note 11 - Notes Payable, and Note 13- Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of such FVO election and the 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes.
The recurring and non-recurring estimated fair value measurements are subjective and are affected by changes in inputs to the valuation models, including our common stock price, and certain Level 3 inputs, including, the assumptions regarding the estimated volatility in the value of our common stock price; our dividend yield; the likelihood and timing of future dilutive transactions, as applicable, along with the risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury security yields. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair values.
Put Rights
In connection with the 42West acquisition, we entered into put agreements with each of the sellers of 42West granting them the right, but not the obligation, to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 237,419 of their shares received as consideration for their membership interest of 42West, including the put rights on the shares earned from the earn out consideration. Based upon the results of operations of 42West during 2017, the sellers earned the additional consideration. In January of 2018, we also entered into put agreements with certain 42West employees granting them the right, but not the obligation, to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 28,140 of their shares received in April 2017 and in July 2018 and those earned from the earn out consideration. We have agreed to purchase the shares at $46.10 per share during certain specified exercise periods as set forth in the put agreements, up until March 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 41,486 shares of common stock and paid approximately $1.6 million cash for put rights that were exercised, including $275,000 for put rights exercised in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we owed the sellers of 42West $560,900 for put rights that were exercised and not paid.
We use a Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the put rights reflects management’s own assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the put rights. The put rights were initially measured on the date of the put agreements and are subsequently measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between balance sheet dates, being recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.
Contingent Consideration
On July 5, 2018, as part of the merger agreement with the former members of The Door, we agreed to pay up to 307,692 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $16.25 and up to $2.0 million in cash if certain adjusted net income targets were met over a four-year period. If the adjusted net income targets are achieved, the contingent consideration is first paid in shares of common stock and the last $2.0 million of contingent consideration earned is paid in cash. On August 17, 2020, as part of the purchase agreement with the former member of Be Social, we agreed to pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.
To value the contingent consideration, we used a Monte Carlo Simulation Model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The contingent consideration was initially measured as of the date of the merger (The Door) and acquisition (Be Social) (July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020) and is subsequently measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between balance sheet dates, being recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.
Income Taxes
We reported an effective tax rate of (7.7)% and (25.4)% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $46,494,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and have recorded a net valuation allowance of $19,107,000 and $16,451,955 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in this deferred tax account.

ITEM 9A.","ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Report on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2020. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c). The framework on which such evaluation was based is contained in the report entitled “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the “COSO Report”). We concluded that based on our evaluation, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020, due to the following material weaknesses:
·
We determined the following design deficiencies related to the entity level control environment, including risk assessment, information and communication and monitoring controls.
-
There is no documented fraud risk assessment or risk management oversight function.
-
There is no documented process to monitor and remediate deficiencies in internal controls.
·
We determined that review and approval of certain aspects of the accounting process including the documented review of accounting reconciliations, complex transactions, revenue recognition and journal entries are inadequate and thus considered to be a material weakness in internal control. Specifically:
-
There are no documented period end procedures for analyzing complex transactions, including business combinations and revenue recognition and documented approval of accounting reconciliations and journal entries.
·
We observed the following inadequate segregation of duties within the accounting process that we determined were a material weakness in our internal control:
-
One individual has the ability to add vendors to the master vendor file. This individual also has access to the Company checkbook that is maintained in a secure location.
Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In order to remediate the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we will continue to implement improvements during fiscal year 2021, under the direction of our board of directors, as follows:
·
Our board of directors intends to review the COSO “Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies” that was published in 2006 including the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring. Based on this framework, the board of directors plans to implement controls as needed assuming a cost benefit relationship. In addition, our board of directors plans to evaluate the key concepts of the updated 2013 COSO “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” as it provides a means to apply internal control to any type of entity.
·
We have entered into an agreement with a third-party consultant that will assist us in analyzing complex transactions and the appropriate accounting treatment starting in the first quarter of 2021.
·
We are enhancing our documentation of month end closing procedures.
·
Enhance our controls over segregation of duties.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. We do not expect that our disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Changes in Internal Controls
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we implemented the following procedures to remediate some of the material weaknesses in internal controls:
·
We have hired an accounting team and consolidated the accounting function of our subsidiaries in one office. We intend to segregate certain duties and document approvals of accounting reconciliations and journal entries and document procedures for analyzing complex transactions, business combinations and revenue recognition.
·
We standardized the accounting software and chart of accounts across all of our subsidiaries, with the exception of Be Social, which we are in the process of doing.
We are neither an accelerated filer nor a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and are not otherwise including in this 2020 Form 10-K an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not required to be attested to by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K.
ITEM 9B.","ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
On October 26 and December 1, 2020, we entered into two convertible promissory notes in the principal amounts of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively with two accredited investors. The convertible promissory notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum and mature two years from the date of issuance. The noteholders may convert the principal balance and any accrued interest at any time before the maturity date of the convertible promissory note using the 90-day trailing trading average price of the Company’s common stock.
The securities referred to above, including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory notes, were offered, issued and sold by the Company to the investors in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Investor represented to the Company that it was an “accredited investor”, as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, and that it was acquiring such securities for investment purposes.

Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Shareholders and Board of Directors
Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.
Coral Gables, Florida
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Uncertainty
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, and at December 31, 2020, has an accumulated deficit, and a working capital deficit that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Convertible Notes Payable and Warrants
As described in Notes 3, 11 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for certain convertible notes issued during 2020 under the fair value option election of ASC 825, Financial Instruments, and accounts for detachable warrants, issued with certain of the convertible notes, as a liability. In order to determine the proper accounting for the convertible notes, an evaluation of the embedded features is required to conclude whether the convertible notes meet the criteria for the fair value option election. The valuation model used in determining the fair value of the convertible notes includes inputs subject to management's judgment, including the estimate of volatility and discount rate. In determining the proper classification of the detachable warrants, an evaluation of their features, including their settlement terms, is required in order to conclude whether the warrants should be accounted for as a liability. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had convertible notes accounted for under the fair value option of $1.5 million and warrant liability of $450,000.
We identified the accounting for convertible notes and detachable warrants and the valuation of the convertible notes as a critical audit matter because of the complexity and judgment involved in evaluating the features of the instruments and in applying the accounting framework and judgments made by management in estimating the fair value of the convertible notes. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased level of effort when performing audit procedures, including the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
·
Utilizing professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in accounting for complex financial instruments to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s interpretation of the terms of the convertible notes and warrants and the appropriateness of management’s application of the authoritative accounting guidance.
·
Testing the accuracy of the source data used by management in the valuation by comparing it to the debt agreement, share price, and stock register.
·
Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation approach and methodologies to assist in: (i) assessing the appropriateness of the methodology used in estimating the fair value of the convertible notes; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain significant assumptions, such as volatility and discount rates; and (iii) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the fair value of the convertible notes determined by management.
Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
As described in Notes 5 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a liability representing the fair value of contingent consideration for two acquisitions that is payable upon the achievement of specific financial performance targets over specified future periods. The balance of the contingent consideration liability was $530,000 as of December 31, 2020. The valuation model used in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration includes inputs subject to management's judgment, including annual asset volatility, discount rate and projections of future performance.
We identified the valuation of contingent consideration as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and judgments made by management in estimating the fair value of the liability. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased effort when assessing the reasonableness of the fair value estimates and assumptions, including the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
·
Evaluating the reasonableness of the projections of future performance by comparing the projections to the acquirees’ historical results and relevant industry data.
·
Utilizing professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation approach and methodologies to assist in (i) assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model used; and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain significant assumptions, including the volatility estimate and discount rate.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill was $19.6 million at December 31, 2020, which was allocated to its reporting units. The Company performs annual impairment tests of goodwill and monitors goodwill for potential indicators of impairment throughout the year. The Company concluded that triggering events occurred for certain of its reporting units and performed an interim impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. The evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Management estimated the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the market and income approaches. Under the market approach, the reporting units’ fair value was estimated using market multiple assumptions of comparable companies in the industry. Under the income approach, a discounted cash flow methodology was utilized which included: (i) management’s estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates, terminal growth rates, and projection of revenue, operating costs and cash flows, (ii) assumptions related to general economic and market conditions, including the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iii) considerations of planned business and operational strategies.
We have identified the valuation of goodwill for certain reporting units as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination was that the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis were challenging to test and required significant auditor judgment, including assessing the impact of future market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.
The primary procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included:
·
Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used by management in the income approach, including: (i) evaluating the reasonableness of projected revenue and operating costs compared to recent performance; (ii) evaluating the general economic and market conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on management’s assumptions, such as the growth of advertising agencies and growth in the entertainment industry; and (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the valuation models.
·
Testing management’s reconciliation of the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units to the indicated market capitalization of the Company as a whole.
·
Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation approach and methodologies to assist in: (i) assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions, including the selection of guideline public companies, and benchmarking certain assumptions to available market data used in the market approach and the discount rate used in the income approach, and (iii) evaluating reasonableness of the market multiples and application of control premium for the market approach.

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
Dolphin Entertainment, Inc., a Florida corporation (the “Company,” “Dolphin,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. Through its acquisitions of 42West LLC (“42West”), The Door Marketing Group, LLC (“The Door”), Shore Fire Media, Ltd (“Shore Fire”), Viewpoint Computer Animation Incorporated (“Viewpoint”), and Be Social Public Relations, LLC (“Be Social”) the Company provides expert strategic marketing and publicity services to all of the major film studios, and many of the leading independent and digital content providers, A-list celebrity talent, including actors, directors, producers, celebrity chefs, social media influencers and recording artists. The Company also provides strategic marketing publicity services and creative brand strategies for prime hotel and restaurant groups and consumer brands. The strategic acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint, and Be Social bring together premium marketing services, including digital and social media marketing capabilities, with premium content production, creating significant opportunities to serve respective constituents more strategically and to grow and diversify the Company’s business. Dolphin’s content production business is a long established, leading independent producer, committed to distributing premium, best-in-class film and digital entertainment. Dolphin produces original feature films and digital programming primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of Dolphin, and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Dolphin Films, Inc, Dolphin SB Productions LLC, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, Dolphin JB Believe Financing, LLC, Dolphin JOAT Productions, LLC, 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social.
The Company enters into relationships or investments with other entities, and in certain instances, the entity in which the Company has a relationship or investment may qualify as a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company has included JB Believe, LLC formed on December 4, 2012 in the State of Florida in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a VIE. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also included Max Steel Productions, LLC formed on July 8, 2013 in the State of Florida.
On November 23, 2020, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida to effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on November 27, 2020 (the “Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock was reduced from 200,000,000 shares to 40,000,000. The par value per share of Common Stock remains unchanged. As a result, each shareholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power remained unchanged. Any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. All references to Common Stock or common stock price in these consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
Restatement to Prior Quarter Financial Statements
The Company has included in this report, its restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, included in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020. The restatement is due to incorrectly reporting pass-through expenses on certain marketing campaigns as revenue and direct cost expense. Upon further review, the Company determined that under these arrangements, it is acting as agent and the pass-through costs should not have been recorded as revenue or direct cost expense in its condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Please see note 4 for further discussion on the restatement.
DOLPHIN ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it has spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected the demand for certain of the services the Company offers resulting in decreased revenues and cash flows. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector and has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients has been negatively impacted by the suspension of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. The Company has taken steps such as freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s financial results.
Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries received five separate unsecured loans for an aggregate amount of $2.8 million (the “PPP Loans”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). Through our acquisition of Be Social, the Company assumed a PPP Loan of $304,169. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments and covered utilities during the measurement period beginning on the date of first disbursement of the PPP Loans. For purposes of the CARES Act, payroll costs exclude compensation of an individual employee in excess of $100,000, prorated annually. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount can be attributable to non-payroll costs. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan attendant to these funds, is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the PPP Loans and qualifying for the forgiveness of the PPP Loans based on its adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company has not yet applied for forgiveness.
Depending on the extent and duration of the pandemic and the related economic impacts, COVID-19 may continue to impact our business and financial results, as well as significant judgements and estimates, including those related to goodwill and other asset impairments and allowances for doubtful accounts.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses, including a net loss of $1,939,192, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and had an accumulated deficit of $97,972,041 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,956,142 and therefore does not have adequate capital to fund its obligations as they come due or to maintain or grow its operations. In addition, several of our subsidiaries operate in industries that have been adversely affected by the government mandated work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. As a result, the Company’s revenues have been negatively impacted by a reduction in the services we provide to clients operating in these industries. The Company has taken measures such as a freeze on hiring, salary reductions, staff reductions and cuts in non-essential spending to mitigate the reduction in revenues. The Company is dependent upon funds from the issuance of debt securities, securities convertible into shares of Common Stock, sales of shares of Common Stock and financial support of certain shareholders. The continued spread of COVID-19 and uncertain market conditions may limit the Company’s ability to access capital. If the Company is unable to obtain funding from these sources within the next 12 months, it could be forced to curtail its business operations or liquidate.
DOLPHIN ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern within one year after these consolidated financial statements are issued. The consolidated financial statements, of which these notes form a part, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company’s management currently plans to raise any necessary additional funds through additional issuances of its Common Stock, securities convertible into its Common Stock and/or debt securities, as well as available bank and non-bank financing, or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital. Any issuance of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. The Company currently has the rights to several scripts, including one currently in development for which it intends to obtain financing to produce and release following which it expects to earn a producer and overhead fee. There can be no assurances that such production, together with any other productions, will be commenced or released or that fees will be realized in future periods or at all. The Company is currently exploring opportunities to expand the services currently being offered by 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social while reducing expenses of their respective operations through synergies with the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in expanding such services or reducing expenses. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries received five separate PPP Loans for an aggregate amount of $2.8 million under PPP which was established under the CARES Act. The application for the PPP Loans requires the Company to, in good faith, certify that the current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support the ongoing operation of the Company. This certification further requires the Company to take into account our current business activity and our ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support the ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The receipt of the funds from the PPP Loans and the forgiveness of the PPP Loans is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the PPP Loans and qualifying for the forgiveness of such PPP Loans based on funds being used for certain expenditures such as payroll costs and rent, as required by the terms of the PPP Loans. The Company intends to apply for forgiveness of the PPP Loans, however, there is no assurance that the Company’s obligation under the PPP Loans will be forgiven. If the PPP Loans are not forgiven, the Company will need to repay the PPP Loans over a two-year period, with an interest rate of 1% per annum, commencing when the SBA notifies the borrower that all or a part of the PPP Loan has not been forgiven.
NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements relate to the expected revenue and costs for investments in digital and feature film projects, estimates of sales returns and other allowances, provisions for doubtful accounts and impairment assessments for investment in feature film projects, goodwill and intangible assets. Actual results could differ materially from such estimates.
Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, management has made appropriate accounting estimates on certain accounting matters, which include the allowance for doubtful accounts, carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets, carrying amount of certain convertible notes payable and embedded derivatives and warrant liabilities, based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s financial statements in future reporting periods.
Statement of Comprehensive Income
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, a statement of comprehensive income has not been included as the Company has no items of other comprehensive income. Comprehensive loss is the same as net loss for all periods presented.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash deposits at financial institutions. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents amounts held by banking institutions as collateral for security deposits under leases for office space in New York City and Newton, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company had a balance of $714,096 and $714,089, respectively, in restricted cash.
Fair Value Option (“FVO”) Election
2020 Convertible Notes
The Company accounts for certain convertible notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2020 under the fair value option election of ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC-825”) as discussed below.
The convertible notes accounted for under the FVO election are each a debt host financial instruments containing embedded features which would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt-host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815. Notwithstanding, ASC 825-10-15-4 provides for the “fair value option” (“FVO”) election, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825-10-15-5, to be afforded to financial instruments, wherein bifurcation of an embedded derivative is not necessary, and the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date.
The estimated fair value adjustment, as required by ASC 825-10-45-5, is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with respect to the portion of the fair value adjustment attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, with the remaining amount of the fair value adjustment recognized as other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. With respect to the above notes, as provided for by ASC 825-10-50-30(b), the estimated fair value adjustment is presented in a respective single line item within other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, since the change in fair value of the convertible notes payable was not attributable to instrument specific credit risk.
Revenue Recognition
The Company earns revenues through its entertainment and publicity segment primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees. The Company also earns revenue from its content production segment primarily by selling the licensing rights to its motion pictures through minimum guarantee arrangements for international sales and sales or usage-based royalties for domestic sales. The Company recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Entertainment publicity and marketing
Revenue from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment consists of fees from the performance of professional services and billings for direct costs reimbursed by clients. Fees are generally recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis, as the services are consumed by our clients, which approximates the proportional performance on such contracts. Direct costs reimbursed by clients are billed as pass-through revenue with no mark-up. We enter into contracts that provide for third-party costs. We typically act as an agent in these types of arrangements and recognize the revenue only on the fees attributable to our performance of the contract and not including the third-party costs which are not recorded on our consolidated statement of operations. Revenues from content produced for digital marketing is recognized upon satisfactory delivery to the client. We also enter into management agreements with a roster of social media influencers and are paid a percentage of the revenue earned by the social media influencer. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, the performance obligation is typically completed and revenue is recognized in the period in which the contract originated.

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Content production
Revenue from motion pictures is recognized upon transfer of control of the licensing rights of the motion picture or web series to the customer. For minimum guarantee licensing arrangements, the amount related to each performance obligation is recognized when the content is delivered, and the window for exploitation right in that territory has begun, which is the point in time at which the customer is able to begin to use and benefit from the content. For sales or usage-based royalty income, revenue is recognized starting at the exhibition date and is based on the Company’s participation in the box office receipts of the theatrical exhibitor and the performance of the motion picture. Cash received and amounts billed in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition is classified as contract liabilities.
Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The Company recorded depreciation expense of $370,746 and $361,951, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of estimated useful lives to be used to calculate depreciation and amortization for principal items of property and equipment are as follow:
The Company periodically reviews and evaluates the recoverability of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Where applicable, estimates of net future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are calculated based on future revenue estimates. If appropriate and where deemed necessary, a reduction in the carrying amount is recorded. The Company has not had any material impairments of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.
Intangible assets
In connection with the acquisitions of 42West on March 30, 2017, The Door on July 5, 2018, Viewpoint on October 31, 2018, Shore Fire on December 3, 2019 and Be Social on August 17, 2020, the Company acquired in aggregate an estimated $13.2 million of intangible assets with finite useful lives initially estimated to range from 3 to 14 years. The intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements. Approximately $0.7 million of favorable lease intangible asset was reclassified in accordance with the new lease accounting in year ended December 31, 2019.

Intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If a triggering event has occurred, an impairment analysis is required. The impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would not be deemed recoverable. Impairment would then be measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. See note 9 for further discussion.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2020, in connection with its acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire, and Be Social, the Company has a balance of $19,627,856 of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet which management has assigned to the entertainment publicity and marketing segment. The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company evaluates goodwill in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, management conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its’ carrying value (including goodwill). The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recorded.
The Company determined that the adverse effects of COVID-19 on certain of the industries in which it operates was an indicator of a possible impairment of goodwill. As such, during the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its estimates and assumptions, with the information available at the time of the assessment, performed an impairment test on the carrying value of its goodwill and determined that an impairment adjustment was not necessary. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, management performed a qualitative analysis and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was not less than its carrying amount. As previously discussed, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its business could result in impairment of goodwill in future reporting periods.
Warrants
When the Company issues warrants, it evaluates the proper balance sheet classification of the warrant to determine whether the warrant should be classified as equity or as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in the Entity’s Own Equity (ASC 815-40), the Company classifies a warrant as equity so long as it is “indexed to the Company’s equity” and several specific conditions for equity classification are met. A warrant is not considered indexed to the Company’s equity, in general, when it contains certain types of exercise contingencies or adjustments to exercise price. If a warrant is not indexed to the Company’s equity or it has net cash settlement that results in the warrants to be accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, or ASC 815-40, it is classified as a derivative liability which is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had warrants that were classified as equity and warrants that were classified as liabilities.

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Convertible Debt and Convertible Preferred Stock
When the Company issues convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, it evaluates the balance sheet classification to determine whether the instrument should be classified either as debt or equity, and whether the conversion feature should be accounted for separately from the host instrument. A conversion feature of a convertible debt instrument or certain convertible preferred stock would be separated from the convertible instrument and classified as a derivative liability if the conversion feature, were it a standalone instrument, meets the definition of an “embedded derivative” in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Generally, characteristics that require derivative treatment include, among others, when the conversion feature is not indexed to the Company’s equity, as defined in ASC 815-40, or when it must be settled either in cash or by issuing stock that is readily convertible to cash. When a conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative, it would be separated from the host instrument and classified as a derivative liability carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the consolidated statements of operations.
If a conversion feature does not meet the conditions to be accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company then determines whether the conversion feature is “beneficial”. A conversion feature would be considered beneficial if the conversion feature is “in the money” when the host instrument is issued or, under certain circumstances, later. If convertible debt contains a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), the amount of proceeds allocated to the BCF reduces the balance of the convertible debt, creating a discount which is amortized over the debt’s term to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. When a convertible preferred stock contains a BCF, after allocating the proceeds to the BCF, the resulting discount is either amortized over the period beginning when the convertible preferred stock is issued up to the earliest date the conversion feature may be exercised, or if the convertible preferred stock is immediately exercisable, the discount is fully amortized at the date of issuance. The amortization is recorded similar to a dividend.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, defined as follows:
Level 1
-
Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2
-
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
Level 3
-
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as of the reporting date.
To account for the acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social, the Company made a number of fair value measurements related to the different forms of consideration paid and of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, the Company makes fair value measurements of its Put Rights and Contingent Consideration. See Notes 5 and 12 for further discussion and disclosures.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires all assets and liabilities arising from leases to be recognized in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB added an optional transition method which the Company elected upon adoption of the new standard. This allowed the Company to recognize and measure leases existing at January 1, 2019 without restating comparative information. In addition, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the lease commencement date. In addition to the Company’s lease agreements, the Company reviews all material new vendor arrangements for potential embedded lease obligations. The asset balance related to operating leases is presented within “right-of-use (ROU) asset” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The current and noncurrent balances related to operating leases are presented as “Lease liability”, in their respective classifications, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
The lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for the leases in existence on the date of adoption or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate on the date of the lease for leases entered into after January 1, 2019. The ROU asset is calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date (i.e. prepaid rent) and initial direct costs incurred by the Company and excluding any lease incentives received from the Lessor. For operating leases, the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for its lease and non-lease components as a single component, and therefore both are included in the calculation of lease liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period the new legislation in enacted. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, management considers estimates of future taxable income. We calculate our current and deferred tax position based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.
Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense.
Loss Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share available to the Company’s common stock shareholders equals net income or loss available to common stock shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share equals net loss available to common stock stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus any additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive instruments were exercised. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later), under the if-converted method. Incremental shares are also included using the treasury stock method. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if any, to be paid upon exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price of the Company’s common stock during the period. The incremental shares (difference between the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation. Potentially dilutive instruments are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive.

Going Concern
In accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-40, Going Concern, management evaluates whether relevant conditions and events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. When relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, initially indicate that it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (and therefore they raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern), management evaluates whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those conditions and events, when implemented, will alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans are considered only to the extent that 1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and 2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 2 related to going concern.
Concentration of Risk
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. These changes did not affect the equity or previously reported net losses.

The Company operates the following business segments:
1)
Entertainment Publicity and Marketing Segment- This segment primarily provides clients with diversified marketing services, including public relations, entertainment and hospitality content marketing, strategic marketing consulting and content production of marketing materials through 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and as of August 17, 2020, Be Social. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s revenues were primarily derived from this segment.
2)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting guidance adopted in fiscal year 2020
In March 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on film production costs Accounting Standards Update (“ASU) 2019-02, (Entertainment Films- Other Assets - Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20)). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years and may be adopted early. The new guidance aligns the accounting for the production costs of an episodic series with those of a film by removing the content distinction for capitalization. It also addresses presentation, requires new disclosures for produced and licensed content and addresses cash flow classification for license agreements to better reflect the economics of an episodic series. The Company adopted this new guidance without a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
In October 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on consolidation ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance provides that indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements should be considered on a proportional basis for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests. The Company adopted this new guidance without a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on fair value measurement (ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value by removing some requirements, modifying others, adding changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and providing the option to disclose certain other quantitative information with respect to significant unobservable inputs in lieu of a weighted average. The Company adopted this new guidance without a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Guidance not yet adopted
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The guidance simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company intends to early adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). This pronouncement enhances and simplifies various aspects of income tax accounting guidance. Among other things, the guidance amends the rules for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod tax allocations and calculating income taxes in interim periods. It also reduces complexity in certain areas, including the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."" ASU 2016-13 requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (""CECL"") model to estimate its lifetime ""expected credit loss"" and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The CECL model is expected to result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also requires new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

NOTE 4 - PRIOR PERIOD REVISION AND RESTATEMENT
Prior Period Revision
During the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company identified certain immaterial errors related to its accounting of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note, 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants and the Pinnacle Note (each as defined in Note 11 - Notes Payable-Convertible Notes below), which were corrected and reflected in the Company’s first quarter, 2020 Form 10-Q. The Company concluded that the conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note and the 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants met the definition of a derivative and should have been recorded at fair value at inception and remeasured at each reporting period with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings. The accretion to par value of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note is recorded as interest expense. The Company had originally accounted for the 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants as equity-linked instruments and had not bifurcated the conversion feature in the 2019 Lincoln Park Note.
The Company also reviewed the Pinnacle Note that had a down round provision allowing for the repricing of the conversion price upon the Company’s issuance of equity securities at a price lower than the Pinnacle Note conversion price. On October 21, 2019, the Company sold shares of Common Stock in a registered public offering, at a price of $3.91 when the Pinnacle Note conversion price was $15.00. As a result, the conversion price of the Pinnacle Note was repriced to $3.91. Due to the repricing, the Company should have recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the date of the repricing and amortized the beneficial conversion feature as interest expense over the remaining life of the Pinnacle Note that matured on January 5, 2020.
In accordance with SAB No. 99, “Materiality,” and SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” the Company evaluated the errors and determined that the related impact was not material to the Company’s financial statements for any prior annual or interim period, but that correcting the cumulative impact of the error would be significant to the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the Company revised the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and quarterly and year to date 2019 unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as of and for the quarterly and year to date periods ended June 30, 2019, September 30, 2019 and consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes presented herein, as applicable. The errors did not impact revenue or loss from operations in the consolidated statement of operations, or net cash used in operations reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for any of those periods.
A summary of the revisions to previously reported financial information is as follows (as adjusted amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 1:5 reverse stock split effectuated November 27, 2020):

Restatement
In its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, included in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020, the Company incorrectly reported certain revenue and direct costs. The errors involved reporting revenues and direct costs that should have been reported as pass-through expenses.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded revenues for certain Statements of Work (“SOWs”) issued under one of the Company’s existing Master Service Agreements (the “Impacted SOW’s”) as a principal. Subsequently, the Company determined that under the Impacted SOW’s they were acting as agent and that the out-of-pocket expenses were pass through expenses and should not have been recorded as revenue or direct costs in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Specifically, due to these errors, revenue and direct costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 were each overstated by $862,710. The error did not affect loss from operations, net loss, loss per share, the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows or the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity.

NOTE 5 - MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
Be Social Public Relations, LLC
On August 17, 2020, (the “Be Social Closing Date”), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social, a California corporation (the “Be Social Purchase”), pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement (the “Be Social Share Purchase Agreement”) dated on the Be Social Closing Date, between the Company and Be Social seller. Be Social is a brand and influencer marketing and public relations agency, offering talent management and brand services publicity in the social media and marketing sectors.
The total consideration paid to the Be Social seller in respect of the Be Social Purchase is $2.2 million as follows: (i) $1,500,000 in cash on the Be Social Closing date (adjusted for Be Social’s indebtedness, working capital and cash targets); (ii) $350,000 in shares of Common Stock at a price of $4.50 per share (69,907 shares) issued to the seller on the Be Social Closing Date, (iii) an additional $350,000 in shares of common stock issued on January 4, 2021, and (iv) up to an additional $800,000 of contingent consideration, 62.5% that will be paid in cash and 37.5% in shares of Common Stock, upon the achievement of specified financial performance targets over the two-year period of fiscal years 2022 and 2023. The Be Social Share Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the parties thereto. The Common Stock issued as part of the consideration on the Be Social Closing Date has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
As a condition to the Be Social Purchase, the seller entered into an employment agreement with the Company to continue as an employee after the closing of the Be Social Purchase. The seller’s employment agreement is through December 31, 2023 and the contract defines base compensation and contains provisions for termination including as a result of death or disability and entitles the employee to vacations and to participate in all employee benefit plans offered by the Company.
The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $2,309,581, which consisted of the following:
The final amount of consideration may potentially change due to other closing adjustments, which have not yet been determined.

The Contingent Consideration arrangement requires that the Company issue up to 307,692 shares of Common Stock and up to $2 million in cash to the Door Members on achievement of adjusted net income targets, (as set forth in the Merger Agreement), based on the operations of The Door over the four-year period beginning January 1, 2018. The fair value of the Contingent Consideration at the Door Closing Date was $1,620,000. The fair value of the Contingent Consideration was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the Contingent Consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the Contingent Consideration as of the Door Closing Date. The key assumptions in applying the Monte Carlo Simulation model are as follows: a risk-free discount rate of between 2.11% and 2.67% based on the U.S government treasury obligation with a term similar to that of the contingent consideration, a discount rate of between 20.0% and 20.5%, and an annual asset volatility estimate of 62.5%. Changes in the fair value on the Contingent Consideration are recorded at each balance sheet date with changes reflected as gains or losses on the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on the fair value as of December 31, 2020.
Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations
The following presents the pro forma consolidated operations as if Be Social and Shore Fire had been acquired on January 1, 2019:
The pro forma amounts for 2019 have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of the acquisitions to reflect (a) the amortization that would have been charged, assuming the intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions had been recorded on January 1, 2019 and (b) to exclude $106,015 of acquisition costs that were expensed by the Company.
The pro forma amounts for 2020 have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies to the financial statements of Be Social and adjusting the results of the acquisition of Be Social to (a) reflect the amortization that would have been charged assuming the intangible assets had been recorded on January 1, 2019 and (b) exclude $93,042 of acquisition related costs that were expensed by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Capitalized Production Costs
Capitalized production costs include the unamortized costs of completed motion pictures and digital projects that have been produced by the Company, costs of scripts for projects that have not been developed or produced and costs for projects that are in production. These costs include direct production costs and production overhead and are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized and participations and residuals costs are accrued in the proportion that current year’s revenue bears to management’s estimate of ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of the motion picture or web series.
Revenues earned from motion pictures was $107,880 and $86,606 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. These revenues were primarily attributable to Max Steel, the motion picture released on October 14, 2016 and Believe released December 25, 2013. The Company amortizes capitalized production costs (included as direct costs) in the consolidated statements of operations using the individual film forecast computation method. The Company had previously amortized all capitalized production costs for Max Steel and Believe and did not record any amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company purchases scripts and incurs other costs, such as preparation of budgets, casting, etc., for other motion picture or digital productions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairments of $45,000 related to costs of projects it does not intend to produce. The Company intends to produce the remaining projects, but they were not yet in production as of December 31, 2020 and there can be no assurance that these projects will be produced on the timelines anticipated or at all. The Company has assessed events and changes in circumstances that would indicate whether the Company should assess if the fair value of the productions is less than the unamortized costs capitalized and, aside from the ones mentioned above, did not identify other indicators of impairment.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total, net capitalized production costs of $271,139 and $203,036, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheets.

On March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender’s Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan was $900,292.
The Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door’s insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31. Based on the Company’s calculations, it believes it is out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, the Company has classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.
Payroll Protection Program Loan
Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, the Company and four of its subsidiaries executed notes and received an aggregate amount of $2,795,700 from five PPP Loans from BankUnited, N.A., under the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. Loans obtained through the PPP are eligible to be forgiven as long as the proceeds are used for qualifying purposes and certain other conditions are met. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on its adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the proceeds from the PPP Loans to fund payroll costs in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of the CARES Act. The Company is following the government guidelines and tracking costs to insure 100% forgiveness of the loan, however the Company has not yet applied for forgiveness on its PPP Loans. To the extent it is not forgiven, the Company would be required to repay that portion at an interest rate of 1% over a period of two years.
As of December 31, 2020, the current and long-terms portion of the loan were $582,438 and $2,517,431, respectively.

NOTE 14 - CONTRACT LIABILITIES
The Company receives advance payments from customers for public relations projects or as deposits for promotional or brand-support video projects, that it records as contract liabilities. Once the work is performed or the projects are delivered to the customer, the contract liabilities are deemed earned and recorded as revenue. Advance payments received are generally for short duration and are recognized once the performance obligation of the contract is met. The balance in contract liability as of December 31, 2019 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had balances of $1,855,209 and $309,880, respectively, in contract liabilities.
NOTE 15 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special-purpose entity (“SPE”). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Company considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
To assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivative or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Company apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE.
The Company evaluated the entities in which it did not have a majority voting interest and determined that it had (1) the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact their economic performance and (2) had the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from these entities. As such the financial statements of JB Believe, LLC are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows presented herein for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The financial statements of Max Steel Productions LLC are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and in consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows presented herein for the period between January 1 and February 20, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019. These entities were previously under common control and have been accounted for at historical costs for all periods presented.
The Company performs ongoing reassessments of (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain triggering events, and therefore would be subject to the VIE consolidation framework, and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE cause the Company’s consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Company is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value unless the VIE is an entity which was previously under common control, which in that case is consolidated based on historical cost. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.
Max Steel VIE was initially formed for the purpose of recording the production costs of the motion picture Max Steel. Prior to the commencement of the production, the Company entered into a Production Service Agreement to finance the production of the film. The Production Service Agreement was for a total amount of $10,419,009 with the lender taking a producer fee of $892,619. Pursuant to the financing agreements, the lender acquired 100% of the membership interests of Max Steel VIE with the Company controlling the production of the motion picture and having the rights to sell the motion picture. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the Production Service Agreement confirmed that Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt under the Production Service Agreement. The Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3,311,198. In addition, the Company assessed its status as primary beneficiary of the VIE and determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary. As such, the Company deconsolidated Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation in the amount of $ $1,484,591 on its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were outstanding balances of $0 and $3,311,198, including accrued interest of $0 and $1,698,280, respectively, related to this debt which are included in the caption debt in the consolidated balance sheets.

Preferred Stock
The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the power to designate the rights and preferences of the preferred stock and issue the preferred stock in one or more series.
On February 23, 2016, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate 1,000,000 preferred shares as Series C with a $0.001 par value which may be issued only to an “Eligible Series C Preferred Stock Holder”. On May 9, 2017, the Board approved the amendment of the Company’s articles of incorporation to reduce the designation of Series C to 50,000 shares with a $0.001 par value. The amendment was approved by the Company’s shareholders on June 29, 2017 and the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Florida (‘the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation”) on July 6, 2017. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each share of Series C will be convertible into one share of common stock, subject to adjustment for each issuance of common stock (but not upon issuance of common stock equivalents) that occurred, or occurs, from the date of issuance of the Series C (the “issue date”) until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the issue date (i) upon the conversion or exercise of any instrument issued on the issued date or thereafter issued (but not upon the conversion of the Series C), (ii) upon the exchange of debt for shares of common stock, or (iii) in a private placement, such that the total number of shares of common stock held by an “Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder” (based on the number of shares of common stock held as of the date of issuance) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of common stock outstanding held by such Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder on such date. An Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder means any of (i) DE LLC for so long as Mr. O’Dowd continues to beneficially own at least 90% and serves on the board of directors or other governing entity, (ii) any other entity in which Mr. O’Dowd beneficially owns more than 90%, or a trust for the benefit of others, for which Mr. O’Dowd serves as trustee and (iii) Mr. O’Dowd individually. Series C will only be convertible by the Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder upon the Company satisfying one of the “optional conversion thresholds”. Specifically, a majority of the independent directors of the Board, in its sole discretion, must determine that the Company accomplished any of the following (i) EBITDA of more than $3.0 million in any calendar year, (ii) production of two feature films, (iii) production and distribution of at least three web series, (iv) theatrical distribution in the United States of one feature film, or (v) any combination thereof that is subsequently approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Board based on the strategic plan approved by the Board. At a meeting of the Board on November 12, 2020, a majority of the independent directors of the Board approved that the “optional conversion threshold” had been met. As a result, the Series C became immediately convertible and as of December 31, 2020 is convertible into 3,806,188 shares of Common Stock, subject to the restriction discussed below. Additionally, DE LLC, as the holder of the Series C is entitled to 11,418,565 votes, which are equal to approximately 63% of the voting securities of the Company.

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
At the meeting of the Board on November 12, 2020, the Board and Mr. O’Dowd agreed to restrict the conversion of the Series C until the Board approved its conversion. Therefore, on November 16, 2020, the Company and DE, LLC entered into a Stock Restriction Agreement pursuant to which the conversion of the Series C is prohibited until such time as a majority of the independent directors of the Board approves the removal of the prohibition. The Stock Restriction Agreement also prohibits the sale or other transfer of the Series C until such transfer is approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Board. The Stock Restriction Agreement shall terminate upon a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Stock Restriction Agreement) of the Company.
The Certificate of Designation also provides for a liquidation value of $0.001 per share and dividend rights of the Series C on parity with the Company’s Common Stock.

NOTE 17 - LOSS PER SHARE
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share:
DOLPHIN ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing income attributable to the shareholders of Common Stock (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share assume that any dilutive equity instruments, such as put rights, convertible notes payable and warrants were exercised and outstanding Common Stock adjusted accordingly, if their effect is dilutive.
Certain of the Company’s convertible notes payable, warrants and the Series C have clauses that entitle the holder to participate if dividends are declared to the common stockholders as if the instruments had been converted into shares of common stock. As such, the Company uses the two-class method to compute earnings per share and attribute a portion of the Company’s net income to these participating securities. These securities do not contractually participate in losses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a net loss and as such the two-class method is not presented.
In periods when the Put Rights are assumed to have been settled at the beginning of the period in calculating the denominator for diluted loss per share, the related change in the fair value of Put Right liability recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the period, is added back or subtracted from net income during the period. The denominator for calculating diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, assumes the Put Rights had been settled at the beginning of the period, and therefore, the related income due to the decrease in the fair value of the Put Right liability during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is subtracted from net loss. The number of shares added to the denominator for the Put Rights is calculated using the reverse treasury stock method that assumes the Company issues and sells sufficient shares at the average period trading price to satisfy the Put Right contracts.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company excluded 847,191 and 842,592 common stock equivalents such as warrants and shares to be issued for convertible debt as inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
NOTE 18 - WARRANTS
A summary of warrant activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
On November 4, 2016, the Company issued warrants to T Squared to purchase up to 50,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $70.00 per share. The warrants contain a down round provision and on October 21, 2019, as a result of the Company’s sale of Common Stock through an underwritten public offering, the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to $3.91 per share. Accordingly, the Company recorded the impact of the exercise price adjustment as deemed dividends of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The warrants were not exercised and expired on January 31, 2020.
In the 2017 offering, the Company issued 243,000 units, each comprising one share of Common Stock, and one warrant exercisable for one share of Common Stock for $23.70 per share. In addition to the units issued and sold in this 2017 offering, the Company also issued warrants to the underwriters to purchase up to an aggregate of 17,010 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $23.70 per share. On January 22, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option with respect to 35,150 warrants to purchase Common Stock at a purchase price of $23.70 per share. In connection with the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company issued to the underwriters warrants to purchase an aggregate of 291 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $23.70 per share. The Company determined that each of these warrants should be classified as equity and recorded the fair value of the warrants in additional paid in capital.

The 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants became exercisable on the six-month anniversary of issuance and for a period of five years thereafter. Pursuant to the warrant agreements, if a resale registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock underlying the 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants is not effective and available at the time of exercise, the 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants may be exercised by means of a “cashless” exercise formula. On June 5, 2020, Lincoln Park exercised the 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants by means of a cashless exercise formula and were issued 75,403 shares of Common Stock.

If a resale registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock underlying the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants is not effective and available at the time of exercise, the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants may be exercised by means of a “cashless” exercise formula. The Company determined that the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants should be classified as freestanding financial instruments that meet the criteria to be accounted for as derivative liabilities and recorded a fair value at issuance of $314,441. The Company recorded expense of $85,559 due to change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2020 and had a balance of $400,000 as of December 31, 2020 recorded in its consolidated balance sheet.

The warrants become exercisable on the six-month anniversary and for a period of five years thereafter. If a resale registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants is not effective and available at the time of exercise, the warrants may be exercised by means of a “cashless” exercise formula. The Company determined that the Series “I” Warrant should be classified as a freestanding financial instrument that meets the criteria to be accounted for as a derivative liability and recorded a fair value at issuance of $40,000. The Company recorded expense of $10,000 due to change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2020, and had a balance of $50,000 as of December 31, 2020 recorded in its consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 21 - INCOME TAXES
Income Tax Benefit is as follows:
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax values at December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:
DOLPHIN ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $46,494,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, the Company has approximately $26,397,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14,856,000 of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3,852,000 of New York and New York City net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. Management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and has recorded a net valuation allowance of $19,107,00 and $16,451,955 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate from continuing operations is as follows:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company does not have any material unrecognized tax benefits and accordingly has not recorded any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months. The Company and its subsidiaries file Federal, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York State, and New York City income tax returns. These returns remain subject to examination by taxing authorities for all years after December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company assessed its status as primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary (see Note 14 - Variable Interest Entities). As a result, the Company removed the tax assets and liabilities allocable to the VIE from its balance sheet. The net effect of the removal of these was zero, as the valuation allowance against the Max Steel deferred tax assets was removed as well with the deconsolidation.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company revised the tax rate used to calculate the state portion of deferred taxes for year ending December 31, 2019, resulting in slightly higher deferred tax assets (net of deferred tax liabilities) and a corresponding slightly higher valuation allowance for year ending December 31, 2019. There was no effect on income tax expense or benefit, or on the effective tax rate of 25.4%.
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. The deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.

Incentive Compensation Plan
On June 29, 2017, the shareholders of the Company approved the Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan was adopted as a flexible incentive compensation plan that would allow us to use different forms of compensation awards to attract new employees, executives and directors, to further the goal of retaining and motivating existing personnel and directors and to further align such individuals’ interests with those of the Company’s shareholders. Under the 2017 Plan, the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for delivery under the 2017 Plan (the “Awards”), at any time during the term of the 2017 Plan, will be 200,000 shares of Common Stock.

Overview
We are a leading provider of integrated human capital management (“HCM”) solutions for human resources (“HR”), payroll, benefits, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our purpose is to allow our customers the freedom to succeed. The workplace is evolving, and we lead the way by making complex HR, payroll, and benefits simple for our clients.
Paychex incorporated in Delaware in 1979 and has a fiscal year that ends May 31st. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and serve clients throughout the U.S. and parts of Europe. As of May 31, 2020, we served greater than 680,000 payroll and PEO clients.
For any organization, a key function is the effective management of human capital which requires both resources and expertise. Organizations are faced with complex and ever-changing requirements, including diverse federal, state and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the workplace is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely, and expect a user experience similar to consumer-oriented Internet applications. We focus on helping small- to medium-sized businesses who do not have the resources or expertise to adapt to the constantly evolving environment. The COVID-19 environment has further accelerated certain trends and increased regulatory complexity.
Paychex offers a wide range of services - including a fully outsourced HR solution, payroll processing, retirement services, and insurance - allowing us to customize our offering to the client's business, whether it is small or large, simple or complex. We believe that we have the breadth of solutions to cover the spectrum of the employee life cycle, but we also allow integration with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today.
Our comprehensive solutions allow our clients to manage their workforces effectively from hire to retire. We provide leading-edge HCM technology solutions, coupled with human expertise, to make complex HR, payroll, and benefits issues simple for our clients. The key features of our solutions are:

·Over 45 years of expertise in HR and payroll with our technology backed by over 200 compliance experts and 600 HR business partners.
We market our solutions through our direct and virtual sales forces which are supported by various corporate lead generation and marketing initiatives. Over 50% of our revenues are gained from our services beyond payroll processing. We focus on providing an industry-leading client experience, and continue to see improving client satisfaction scores and retention.
Company Strategy
Our mission is to be the leading provider of HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions by being an essential partner to small and medium-sized businesses across the U.S. and parts of Europe.

With over 600 HR business partners, we have extensive expertise that we believe sets us apart in the industry.

Our Solutions
Our solutions bring together payroll and HCM software with flexible, personalized technology-enabled service capabilities. Clients have the option of doing payroll online using our SaaS technology, outsourcing to our payroll specialists or using a combination of those solutions. Payroll is then integrated with HCM software modules for clients who have more complex HR needs. We also provide comprehensive HR outsourcing through our administrative services organization (“ASO”) and PEO solutions. The integration of leading-edge technology and flexible service options allows us to meet our clients’ needs how, when, and where they want.
HCM Technology: Paychex Flex is our proprietary HCM SaaS platform that unites HR, payroll, time and attendance, and benefits processes to maximize efficiency and savings. Paychex Flex helps clients manage the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement, providing an integrated suite of solutions including recruiting, onboarding, HR, time and attendance and employee benefits. It utilizes a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records. Clients can select the modules they need and easily add on additional services as they grow. In addition, Paychex Flex presents function-focused analytics throughout the platform, assisting HR leaders with making more informed business decisions. Paychex Flex uses a mobile-first design throughout our HCM suite, which allows full functionality of all application components, regardless of device or screen size. We believe our Paychex mobile applications add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access on their mobile device.
We continue to invest in Paychex Flex, making significant enhancements designed to simplify the complexity of HR. The latest enhancements include expansion of our integration capabilities to connect users with some of the world’s leading business tools, a Help Center that gives users access to training and how-to tutorials, a pay-on-demand solution to grant employees access to earned wages before their scheduled pay day, a custom dashboard, and a newly enhanced grid entry view which offers more flexibility, customization, and visibility into employee pay data. We also expanded into wearable technology where Paychex Flex Time users can also use our smartwatch solution, which enables users to track time worked via their smartwatch, making the time and attendance tracking process easier for an increasingly remote workforce.
HR and Compliance Expertise: Paychex supports its HCM software solutions with over 45 years of experience. We have over 600 HR professionals who are dedicated to our clients and have the experience and training to provide HR best practices and advice. Our HR business partners are available to provide our ASO and PEO clients with specific guidance on HR issues. In addition, we have over 200 compliance professionals who are in real-time contact with tax agencies and regulators to understand upcoming or newly enacted laws and regulations, and advocate for our clients’ interests. The contributions of these compliance experts are intended to ensure that our HCM solutions are updated timely to adhere to regulations and to help our clients stay in compliance.
Technology-Enabled Client Service: Paychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, an individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via a multi-product service center. In addition, mid-market clients can utilize a relationship manager for more personalized service. This flexible platform services our small- to medium-sized clients, and a portion of our PEO business.
Within Paychex Flex there is embedded technology to assist clients. The Paychex Flex Intelligence Engine includes the Flex Assistant, a customer service chatbot who can answer over 200 commonly asked questions. Our Flex Intelligence Engine allows clients to elect their preference for learning - via written how-to-documents, tutorial-style video vignettes, or a guided interactive tour. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away, with the entire chat conversation available real-time to provide a better, more personalized service experience.
The platform embeds self-service capabilities that empower client employees to manage their HR and benefits information from any location, on any device. These self-service capabilities allow for greater access and convenience for client employees and greater productivity for clients.
Our Clients
Paychex has HR solutions to fit the needs of any small- to medium-sized business, from do-it-yourself payroll to comprehensive HR outsourcing. The target market for our integrated HCM solutions is small- to medium-sized businesses. Within this space, we serve a diverse base of clients operating in a broad range of industries throughout the U.S. and parts of Europe. The flexibility and scalability of our solutions allow our clients to define the solution that best meets their needs and to grow within the Flex platform. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that generally do not contain specified contract periods, and may be terminated by either party with 30-days’ notice of termination. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), client retention was at record levels of over 83% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year.
We support our small-business clients, reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our products and customer service options for a quick and easy payday. Clients may choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or process payroll themselves utilizing our proprietary, robust SaaS Paychex Flex platform and our SurePayroll® SaaS-based products. Both products allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone).
Our mid-market clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs, though with the environment of increasing regulations, we believe the need for HR outsourcing services has been moving down-market. Any of our clients on Paychex Flex can opt for the integrated suite of HCM solutions, which allows clients to choose the services and software that will meet the needs of their business.
While Paychex Flex is our primary SaaS-based platform utilized by the majority of our clients for their HCM needs, there are some clients that use other platforms, including SurePayroll clients, certain PEO clients, and some smaller tenured clients.
Both our small and mid-market clients can choose one of our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, which include ASO and PEO solutions, and participate in our benefits offerings, which include our insurance and retirement services. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. Our retirement services product line offers many plan design options to meet the client’s requirements, as well as investment options.
Description of Services
Within our HCM solutions we offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse HR and payroll needs. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Our offerings often leverage the information gathered in our base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.
Our portfolio of services is comprised of the following:
Management Solutions:
·Payroll processing services: Our payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.
·Payroll tax administration services: Payroll tax administration services provide for accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable federal, state, and local tax or regulatory agencies. In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending up to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.
·Employee payment services: Our employee payment services provide an employer the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.
We also allow employers to opt for more flexible pay options. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. In addition, we are giving business owners the ability to leverage real-time payments to process payroll and deliver net pay to their employees immediately for time worked. Pay-on-demand functionality enables an employee to request access to a portion of earned pay before the scheduled pay date, which is deposited into a traditional bank account or a third-party account.
·Regulatory compliance services: We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet.
·HR Solutions (ASO): Our ASO offers businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. Paychex HR Essentials is an ASO product that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics.
·Retirement services administration: Our retirement services product line offers a variety of options to clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These services provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients may choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services clients include relationships with financial advisors.
·HR administration services: We offer cloud-based HR administration software for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance solutions, recruiting, and onboarding.
oPaychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee personnel information, performance management, HR compliance and reporting. Our Learning Management solution compliments our performance management. When combined with our workflow and approval engine, we offer clients the flexibility to capture ongoing performance feedback, recommend and enroll employees in specific training courses, and leverage automated workflows to track progress and approve compensation changes tied to performance.
oBenefits administration software manages the employee-benefit enrollment process for both open-enrollment and life events.
oTime and attendance products, including our integrated Flex Time software, provide timekeeping, scheduling, and workforce analytics. The InVisionTM IRIS Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, provides fast and accurate time capture. Paychex Flex Time also works with wearable technology to allow for employees to clock in and out using their smartwatch.
oApplicant tracking suite provides technology that streamlines, simplifies, and drives the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes.
·Other HR services and products: We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents.
·Business services: We offer various business services to small- to medium-sized businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Paychex Advance, LLC, provides a portfolio of services to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via the purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation. Paychex Promise, a subscription-based service, offers protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address routine challenges of running a successful business. The primary offering is payroll protection, which extends the collection of payroll funds from a client’s bank account by seven days without interruption of service or charges for insufficient funds. In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for services such as payment processing services, financial fitness programs, and a small-business loan resource center.
PEO and Insurance Solutions:
·PEO solutions: Our licensed subsidiaries, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC, HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (“HROi”), and Oasis offer businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. What differentiates our PEO solutions from our ASO solutions is that we serve as a co-employer of our clients’ employees, offer health care coverage to PEO client employees, and assume the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance and certain benefit insurance offerings. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO solutions.
·Insurance solutions: Our licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing employers to expand their employee benefit and corporate offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, cyber security protection, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. Our virtual sales force manages inbound sales leads for the under 10 employee space, sales in areas without a direct sales force presence, and sales of various ancillary services.
In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client referrals. Approximately 50% of our new small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services.
We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business SolutionsTM Program. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2021. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations.
Our website is available at www.paychex.com. It is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct and virtual sales forces. The website allows us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our products and services and offers information about our core lines of business: human resources (www.paychex.com/human-resources), payroll (www.paychex.com/payroll), benefits (www.paychex.com/employee-benefits), and insurance (www.paychex.com/business-insurance).
Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance primarily to clients and the CPA community. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory change as well as HR and business best practices. Paychex WORX, available at www.paychex.com/worx, is a digital destination for insightful resources useful for businesses at every stage, from entrepreneur to enterprise. Paychex WORX highlights our expertise, and ability to help businesses of all sizes with a wide range of HR and financial information for current clients and prospects alike.
We also track current regulatory issues that impact the business community and provide regulatory updates. We issue small business trend reports through our Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch. Our Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals. Through Paychex Flex, AccountantHQ offers access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts, along with an extensive accountant resource library. AccountantHQ drives efficiency by putting accountants in the best position possible to easily access critical client payroll and HR data, as well as powerful reporting tools, including our Paychex Protection Program (“PPP”) loan forgiveness estimator.
Markets and Competition
We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 8 million employer firms in the target markets that we currently serve in the U.S.
The market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online service providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our products also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.
Competition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. We believe that our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, combined with personalized service provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled service capabilities, distinguishes us from our competitors.
Software Maintenance and Development
The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success.
Employees
We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is important to our future success and growth. As of May 31, 2020, we employed approximately 15,800 people, of which approximately 15,600 people were employed on a full-time basis.
Intellectual Property
We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.
Seasonality
There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Solutions ASO and PEO businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses, clients requesting additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. The following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. These are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. In addition, refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 and such impact could be materially adverse. The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In the United States and globally, governmental authorities instituted certain preventative measures, including border closures, travel restrictions, operational restrictions on certain businesses, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines and recommendations to practice social distancing. These restrictions disrupted and may continue to disrupt economic activity, resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses, volatility in the global capital markets, instability in the credit and financial markets, labor shortages, regulatory recommendations to provide relief for impacted consumers, disruption in supply chains, and restrictions on many hospitality and travel industry operations.
The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration or recurrence, of the pandemic, the related length and severity of its impact on the U.S. and global economy, and the continued governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and economic disruption. Impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to continue to pose risks to our business for the foreseeable future, heightened many of the risks and uncertainties identified below, and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our business is substantially dependent on our clients continued use of our solutions and services, and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them. Our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. If they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection, we may not be paid for services we already provided, and our client base will shrink, which will lower our revenue. If under financial pressure, our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the services and solutions we provide, which would reduce our revenue. Our clients may decrease their workforce, which would decrease their demand for our services. Because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry, we may face pricing pressure on our services and face challenges in onboarding new clients, which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations. If the third-party service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients, our operations could be materially disrupted and we could face significant penalties or liabilities.
Our operational risk, including data security risk, has increased during the pandemic as a majority of our employees are working remotely and cybercriminal activity increases in an attempt to profit from the disruption to typical operations.
There has been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state, local, and foreign governments following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients. These regulations may be unclear, difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations. The failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could result in financial penalties, legal proceedings, and reputational harm.
Our business, services, and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies. Many of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed according to government regulations that often change. Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business.
Our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Our services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the ACA and anti-money laundering rules. The growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations. The enactment of new laws and regulations, modifications of existing laws and regulations, or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business. Failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, as a U.S. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). A violation of a sanction or embargo program, or of the FCPA, or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations.
We may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions, and enhancements and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards. We continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. If our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost and innovation relative to our competitors. The failure to provide more efficient and user-friendly customer-facing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations. The failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities.
We could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or Internet disruptions. We rely upon information technology (“IT”) networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. Cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft of personal or other sensitive information, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory sanction, or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities and Internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. In addition, cybercriminals may seek to exploit the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by attempting to engage in payment-related fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems through phishing or other means that may be more successful when most of our employees are working remotely.
Data Security and Privacy Leaks: We collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, and our employees, including: bank account numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber-attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. We may be particularly targeted for cyber-attack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain. Vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.
Our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information. We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While we have security systems and IT infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, if our security measures are breached, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. Any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Third-parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.
Data Loss and Business Interruption: If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, including Internet or systems failure, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, both the Company and our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Hardware, applications and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients’ business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations. Our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as their financial and payroll data. Our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy. In the U.S., we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the ACA, federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification and data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020. In addition, the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation became fully effective in May 2018. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.
In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, severe weather including events resulting from climate change, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, public health emergency, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms, and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients.
We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions. As part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. These service providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.
We may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business. Many federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “co-employment” relationship within our PEO business. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. There is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws. Incurring additional liabilities related to our PEO business may adversely affect our results of operations.
We may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends. Within our PEO business, we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees. The insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, our costs could increase. In addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms. Also, as a co-employer in the PEO, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform, which may result in increased costs. Increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients.
Our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us. As part of our payroll processing service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities. It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. We have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. If a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf, our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.
Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance. We receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income.
We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment. Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. These conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit.
We invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. However, these funds held for clients are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility. The interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds. If we sell available-for-sale securities to satisfy short-term funding requirements, we may recognize losses, which would reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients.
Constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. Historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. However, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. Growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited. In addition, our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited. See also “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” If all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities, and difficulties in integrating operations. Successful integration involves many challenges, including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services, our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the loss of key employees of an acquired business. The integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process. In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill, interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition, and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders. If the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.
Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the “Agreement”) that we entered into in January 2019 in connection with our acquisition of Oasis, contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole), certain merger transactions, certain sales of assets and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The Agreement also contains financial covenants, which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis, that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00. In addition, certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20% of our consolidated stockholders’ equity. If we do not comply with these covenants, it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.
We may not be able to attract and retain qualified people, which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction. Our success, growth, and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified people at all levels, including management, technical, compliance, and sales personnel. Competition for these individuals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain our key people, or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly-qualified individuals in the future, which could harm our future success.
Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third-parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete. Third-parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. To the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation, we could incur significant expenses and/or be required to pay substantial damages. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation. The litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming.
In the event we receive negative publicity, our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed, and clients may not use our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our corporate employees, or others associated with us, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. If we are unable to maintain quality HCM and employee benefit-related solutions and PEO and insurance solutions, our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish. In addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees.
We are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees, or other costs. We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third-parties for various actions. From time to time, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, and employment and labor law matters. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K for a discussion on this type of risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

None.
Item 2.","Item 2. Properties
We owned and leased the following properties as of May 31, 2020:
Our facilities in Rochester, New York house various distribution, processing, and technology functions, certain ancillary functions, a telemarketing unit, and other back-office functions. Facilities outside of Rochester, New York are in various locations throughout the U.S. and house our service centers, fulfillment centers and sales functions. Our international locations primarily house our European operations in Denmark and Germany and a location in India houses information technology, service, and sales support functions. We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to be available to meet our needs.
Item 3.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, employment-related claims, tax claims, patent, statutory, and other matters.
Our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Item 6.","Item 6. Selected Financial Data
(1)In fiscal 2017, we early-adopted new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments. As a result, a discrete tax benefit was recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. This discrete tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per diluted share, $0.02 per diluted share, $0.04 per diluted share, and $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017, respectively.
(2)In fiscal 2018, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) significantly impacted our net income, basic and diluted earnings per share, and return on stockholders’ equity.

We support our small-business clients, reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. Clients may choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or process payroll themselves utilizing our proprietary, robust, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) Paychex Flex® platform and our SurePayroll® SaaS-based products. Our mid-market clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs. However, in the current environment of increasing regulations, we believe the needs for HR outsourcing solutions have been moving down-market. Any of our clients using Paychex Flex can opt for the integrated suite of HCM solutions, which allows clients to choose the services and software that will meet the needs of their business.
Our portfolio of HCM and employee benefit-related services is disaggregated into two categories, Management Solutions and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions, as discussed in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
Our mission is to be the leading provider of HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions by being an essential partner to small and medium-sized businesses across the U.S. and parts of Europe. We believe that success in this mission will lead to strong, long-term financial performance. Our strategy focuses on providing industry-leading, integrated technology; increasing client satisfaction; expanding our leadership in HR; growing our client base; and engaging in strategic acquisitions.
We continue to focus on driving growth in the number of clients, revenue per client, total revenue and profits, while providing industry-leading service and technology solutions to our clients and their employees. We maintain industry-leading margins by managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business, particularly in leading-edge technology. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we believe that investing in our products, people, and service capabilities will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.
Effective December 20, 2018, the Company acquired Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P. (“Oasis”). Upon closing, Oasis became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Oasis is an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services. The purchase price was $992.2 million, net of $262.3 million in cash acquired, including $132.1 million of restricted cash. The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of long-term private placement debt totaling $800.0 million.
Fiscal 2020 Financial Highlights
Financial highlights for fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, are as follows:
·Total revenue increased 7% to $4.0 billion. Oasis contributed approximately 4% to the growth in total revenue.
·Operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion.
·Net income increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted net income(1) increased 5% to $1.1 billion.

Client retention was at record levels of over 83% of the beginning client base for fiscal 2020. Client retention was over 82% for fiscal 2019 and approximately 81% of the beginning client base for fiscal 2018.
While our HR product offerings provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll, they effectively leverage payroll processing data. These services are included as part of the integrated HCM solution within Paychex Flex or provided through the Prism HR PEO platform. The following table illustrates the growth in selected HR product offerings:

·Other enhancements including, grid entry view capabilities and the ability for employees and administrative users to create a custom dashboard.
We continue to strengthen our position in the industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, businesses of all sizes, and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance, helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage. Both this website and www.paychex.com/worx have sections dedicated to the topic of health care reform.
COVID-19 Response
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our operations and employees, our customers’ businesses, and the markets we serve in the three months ended May 31, 2020 (the “fourth quarter”). The health and safety of our employees remains our top priority. We were expedient with the implementation of our business continuity plan, which included moving 95% of our workforce to work remotely and restricting unnecessary travel. Results of operations for the fourth quarter were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses suspended operations. Management Solutions revenue was impacted by a decline in check volumes, partially offset by increased penetration of retirement services and time and attendance services. The decline in check volumes was due to a reduction in the number of clients processing payrolls as well as the number of employees paid due to state and regional shutdowns. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue was impacted by a decline in the number of worksite employees serviced by our existing clients. Insurance Solutions revenue was impacted by a decrease in the number of health and benefit applicants and a decline in workers’ compensation premiums. Since the end of April, we have seen sequential improvement in our key business metrics across our lines of business.
As our clients continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority remains helping them keep their businesses open and return to more normal operations. Our blend of technology and service provides valuable tools and resources to assist our clients and their employees during this critical time. The technology investments we made to our Paychex Flex payroll and human resources suite of products positioned us to service our clients and support them in managing a remote workforce.
We created a COVID-19 Help Center on our website to assist our clients and provide them with the support and resources they need, including:
Webinars and white papers with information on the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, including the historic PPP, and Families First Coronavirus Response Act;
Guidance on the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan and debt relief process,
Interactive PPP loan estimation tool for businesses who are considering or have received funding through the SBA program; and
State-by-state resources to help our clients understand specific directives that may impact their business.
The COVID-19 Help Center also provides resources to our key business partners, including accountants, financial institutions, financial advisors, and national associations. The COVID-19 Help Center has been translated into Spanish to serve our Spanish-speaking clients.
Our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility allowed us to successfully manage through the initial impact of COVID-19 while protecting our cash flow and liquidity. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of future changes to market and economic conditions related to COVID-19 and will assess the potential impact to our business and financial position. We expect to take a cautious approach to modifying our office and travel restrictions and will wait until we have a clearer vision on how the pandemic unfolds and utilizing guidance provided by the federal, state, and local governments.
For further information on the risks posed to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for Fiscal Years:
(1)Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
n/m - not meaningful
We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2020, we had no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios are as follows:
(1)The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $112.4 million as of July 15, 2020.
(2)The Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.0% to 0.25% as of May 31, 2020, in the range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of May 31, 2019, and in the range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of May 31, 2018.
(3)These items exclude the impact of variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”), as they are tied to short-term interest rates.
Management Solutions revenue: Management Solutions revenue was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019, reflecting growth of 3% and 4%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from increases in our client base and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly HR outsourcing, retirement services, and time and attendance. Retirement services revenue growth for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from an increase in the number of retirement services plans, along with an increase in revenue earned on the asset value of participants’ 401(k) funds.
PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue: PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue was $990.6 million for fiscal 2020 and $814.2 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting growth of 22% and 46%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year periods. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was driven by growth in clients across our PEO business. In addition, for fiscal 2019, PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth was driven by growth in client worksite employees across our PEO business.
Insurance Solutions revenue for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients, offset by declining rates in the workers’ compensation market. In addition, for fiscal 2019, Insurance Solutions revenue was impacted by an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants.
Interest on funds held for clients: Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for fiscal 2020 and 27% for fiscal 2019 to $86.9 million and $80.6 million, respectively. For fiscal 2020 the increase was due to higher realized gains, offset by lower average investment balances and average interest rates. The realized gains primarily resulted from the strategic repositioning of our client fund portfolio to enhance liquidity in response to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. For fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.
Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% and 2% for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2020, funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by lower client fund collections due to COVID-19 and changes in client base mix, offset by wage inflation and timing of collections and remittances. For fiscal 2019, the decrease in average investment balances for funds held for clients was primarily driven by the impact of lower client withholdings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), and changes in client base mix, partially offset by the impact of wage inflation.
Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market Risk Factors
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominately in municipal bonds - including general obligation bonds and revenue bonds; U.S. government agency and treasury securities; and corporate bonds. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.
During fiscal 2020, our primary short-term investment vehicles were U.S. government agency and treasury securities, VRDNs, and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. We have insignificant exposure to European investments. We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
During fiscal 2020, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 1.8%, compared to 1.9% and 1.5% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, earnings decrease from our short-term investments, and over time earnings will decrease from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2020 had an average duration of 2.9 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates.
The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2020 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.
The Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points three times in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 after periodically raising the rate from December 2015 through May 2019. Then in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds rate a total of 150 basis points. As of May 31, 2020, the Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.0% to 0.25% as compared to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of May 31, 2019, and in the range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of May 31, 2018. There continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor market conditions.
Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
governmental action resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;
daily interest rate changes;
seasonal variations in investment balances;
actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale securities;
the proportion of taxable and tax-exempt investments;
changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and
financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates.
Subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to earnings from a 25-basis-point change in short-term interest rates would be approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.
Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments) averaged approximately $4.8 billion for fiscal 2020. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 40% invested in short-term securities and VRDNs with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 60% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.
The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected net unrealized gains of $100.0 million and $19.7 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively.

REPORT ON MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013). Based on our assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is appointed by the Company’s Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, and as a part of their integrated audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases on June 1, 2019.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Insurance Reserves - Workers’ Compensation Insurance Reserves
As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers workers’ compensation insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. As of May 31, 2020, the total liability for workers’ compensation insurance reserves is $173.6 million. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, management uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. The evaluation, review and determination of estimated ultimate losses by the Company’s appointed actuary are based on actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon estimated loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to PEO insurance reserves - workers’ compensation insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the workers’ compensation insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing our procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the estimated loss development factors and other factors such as the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends, and (ii) the audit effort included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s workers’ compensation insurance reserves, including controls over the development of management’s assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the estimated loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the workers’ compensation insurance reserves and (ii) comparison of this independent estimate to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate. Developing an independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and (ii) evaluating management’s assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the estimated loss development factors and other factors such as the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note A - Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of business: Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Paychex”) is a leading provider of integrated human capital management (“HCM”) solutions for human resources (“HR”), payroll, benefits, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States (“U.S.”). The Company also has operations in parts of Europe.
Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one segment. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated within the U.S. The Company also generates revenue within parts of Europe, which represented one percent of the Company’s total revenue for each of the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”) and May 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), and less than one percent for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). Long-lived assets in Europe were approximately five percent of total long-lived assets of the Company as of both May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively.
Within Paychex’s HCM solutions, Paychex offers a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that allow its clients to meet their diverse HR and payroll needs. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Paychex’s offerings often leverage the information gathered in its base payroll processing service, allowing the Company to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.
Paychex supports its small business clients utilizing its proprietary, robust, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) Paychex Flex® platform and the Company’s SurePayroll® SaaS-based products. Both products allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone). Paychex’s mid-market clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs. However, in the current environment of increasing regulations, the Company believes the needs for HR outsourcing solutions have been moving down-market. Any of the Company’s clients on Paychex Flex can opt for the integrated suite of HCM solutions, which allows clients to choose the services and software that will meet the needs of their business.
Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised primarily of the fees earned on the portfolio of HCM services, which include payroll processing, complementary HR management and administration services, PEO (“Professional Employer Organization”) solutions, and insurance agency commissions. Refer to Note B of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s service revenue.
Basis of presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain disclosures are reported as zero balances due to rounding.
Effective June 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU No. 2016-02”) as discussed in the “Recently adopted accounting pronouncements” section of this Item 8. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) have been updated to comply with the new standard.
Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported consolidated earnings.
Subsequent Events: On July 9, 2020, Paychex announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share payable August 27, 2020 to stockholders of record as of August 3, 2020.
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market securities, and other investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents include funds collected from the Company’s PEO clients for the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Funds of $136.4 million and $178.8 million collected from PEO clients are included in cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively.
Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are recorded at fair value, and consist of cash and cash equivalents, primarily money market securities, included in funds held for clients and cash that is restricted in use for certain payment of workers’ compensation policies.
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts: Accounts receivable balances are shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $12.5 million and $7.5 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. These balances include: trade receivables for services provided to clients and purchased receivables related to payroll funding arrangements with clients in the temporary staffing industry. Trade receivables were $84.7 million and $94.5 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Purchased receivables were $311.9 million and $333.5 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Accounts receivable are written off and charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company has exhausted all collection efforts without success. No single client had a material impact on total accounts receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.
PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections: The Company recognizes a liability for worksite employee gross wages and related payroll tax liabilities at the end of the period in which the worksite employee performs work, and where it assumes, under state regulations, the obligation for the payment of payroll and payroll tax liabilities. The estimated payroll and payroll tax liabilities are recorded in accrued worksite employee compensation and related items on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated unbilled receivables, including estimated revenues, offset by advance collections from clients, are recorded as PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, advance collections included in PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections were $6.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments: Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent pricing service. The funds held for clients portfolio also includes cash and cash equivalents such as money market securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, realized gains and losses from the funds held for clients portfolio and corporate investments portfolio are included in interest on funds held for clients and other (expense)/income, net, respectively.
Concentrations: Substantially all of the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at large well-capitalized (as defined by their regulators) financial institutions. These deposits may exceed the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s deliverable securities, primarily municipal bond securities, are held in custody with certain of the aforementioned financial institutions, for which that institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable securities are primarily time deposits and money market funds.
Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation: Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are generally as follows:
Normal and recurring repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Software development and enhancements: Expenditures for software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which are generally three to five years. Software developed as part of the Company’s main processing platform is depreciated over 12 years. For software developed for internal use, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization: The Company had $1.8 billion of goodwill as of both May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal fourth quarter. A qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in the fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below their carrying value. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of the Company’s testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for the fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.
Intangible assets are comprised primarily of client list acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from three to 12 years. Certain client lists use an accelerated method, while other intangible assets use the straight-line method of amortization. In addition, the Company has intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company has determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets for the fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.
Foreign Currency: The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. The resulting non-cash foreign currency translation adjustments, representing unrealized gains or losses, are included in Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax. The Company did not have any material realized gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions during the fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.
Revenue recognition: Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients. Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company’s service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for funding of payrolls for temporary staffing agency clients via the purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 45 days. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
The Company receives advance payments for set-up fees from its clients. Advance payments received for certain of the Company’s service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists.
PEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to the Company’s guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where the Company retains risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue. Refer to Note B of this Item 8 for further discussion of the PEO pass-through costs.
Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.
Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts: The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company does not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. The Company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). The Company also recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. The Company determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance the Company’s ability to satisfy future performance obligations.
The assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. The Company regularly reviews its deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 or May 31, 2019.
Cost of service revenue: The Company’s costs and expenses applicable to total service revenue represent direct costs associated with providing HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance services. This includes labor-related costs, direct costs related to certain PEO offerings, postage and delivery costs, facility costs, professional services, and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including internally developed software.
Selling, general and administrative expenses: The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses represent labor-related costs, including amortization of deferred sales commissions and bonuses, corporate asset depreciation and amortization, marketing, and other general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company.
PEO insurance reserves: As part of the PEO solution, the Company offers workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The evaluation, review and determination of estimated ultimate losses by the Company’s appointed actuary are based on actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon estimated loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates.
The Company’s maximum individual claims liability under its PEO workers’ compensation insurance policies was $1.0 million for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, the Company’s maximum individual claims liability ranged from $0.5 million to $1.0 million under its PEO workers’ compensation insurance policies. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the Company had recorded current liabilities of $72.3 million and $71.1 million, respectively, and long-term liabilities of $101.3 million and $99.2 million, respectively, on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation insurance reserves.
With respect to PEO health insurance, the Company offers various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier. In addition, the Company also provides self-insured dental and vision plans to certain of its PEO clients. Under the minimum medical premium insurance arrangement and self-insured dental and vision plans, the Company’s health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with its service contract with the carrier. The claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. The Company’s maximum individual claims liability was $0.3 million under its policies during both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Amounts accrued related to the health insurance and dental and vision plan reserves were $36.7 million and $25.4 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. These amounts are included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for the fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.
Leases: At contract inception, the Company determines if the new contractual arrangement is a lease or contains a leasing arrangement. If a contract contains a lease, the Company evaluates whether it should be classified as an operating or a finance lease. Currently, all of the Company’s leases have been classified as operating leases. Upon modification of the contract, the Company will reassess to determine if a contract is or contains a leasing arrangement.
The Company records lease liabilities based on the future estimated cash payments discounted over the lease term, defined as the non-cancellable time period of the lease, together with all the following:
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option; and
periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option.
Leases may also include options to terminate the arrangement or options to purchase the underlying lease property. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Lease components provide the Company with the right to use an identified asset, which consist of the Company’s real estate properties and office equipment. Non-lease components consist primarily of maintenance services.
As an implicit discount rate is not readily determinable in the Company’s lease agreements, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach utilizing publicly available information related to our unsecured borrowing rates. For certain leases with original terms of 12 months or less, the Company recognizes lease expense as incurred and does not recognize any lease liabilities. Short-term and long-term portions of operating lease liabilities are classified as other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities, respectively, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
A right-of-use (“ROU”) asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability with adjustments, if applicable, for lease incentives, initial direct costs incurred by the Company, and lease prepayments made prior to or at lease commencement. ROU assets are classified as operating lease right-of-use assets, net of accumulated amortization, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the carrying value of ROU assets if there are indicators of potential impairment, and performs the analysis concurrent with the review of the recoverability of the related asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group is determined to not be fully recoverable and is in excess of its estimated fair value, the Company will record an impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss during fiscal 2020.
Fixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and are often due to changes in an external market rate or the value of an index (e.g. Consumer Price Index). Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
Stock-based compensation costs: All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life, and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model. The Company will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.
The Company’s policy is to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. The assumptions for forfeitures are determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have an impact on the estimated fair value of a future award.
Refer to Note F of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.
Income taxes: The Company accounts for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company also maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements, the Company must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the amount the Company expects to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact the Company’s results of operations or financial position. The Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was $26.5 million as of May 31, 2020 and $21.6 million as of May 31, 2019. Refer to Note L of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions.
Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements: In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02. This guidance, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02 on June 1, 2019, utilizing the alternative transition method provided by the FASB in ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” and did not restate comparative periods as permitted under the standard.
The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 increased ROU lease-related assets and liabilities by $116.4 million and resulted in ROU asset and lease liability balances of $116.4 million and $135.3 million, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 1, 2019. The difference between the ROU assets and lease liabilities relates to $18.9 million of unamortized landlord allowances and lease incentives. The Company has updated its control framework for new internal controls and made changes to existing internal controls related to the new standard. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the financial covenants set forth in the Company’s credit facilities and long-term borrowing agreement. Refer to Note I of this Item 8 for additional information on the new standard.
As part of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, the Company elected the following practical expedients: 1) lease vs. non-lease components relating to the real estate asset class; 2) the short-term lease exemption; and 3) the package of practical expedients, which permits the Company to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs under the new standard. In addition, the Company elected not to adopt the practical expedient related to hindsight.
In June 2019, the Company also adopted the following ASUs, none of which had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements:
ASU No. 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting;”
ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income;” and
ASU No. 2017-08, “Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities.”
Recently issued accounting pronouncements: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU No. 2020-04 provides guidance on optional expedients for a limited time to ease the operational burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform (LIBOR) on financial reporting. This guidance is effective upon the ASUs issuance on March 12, 2020 and companies may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company’s credit facilities already contain comparable alternative reference rates that would automatically take effect upon the LIBOR phase out, and it is also reviewing its commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as a reference rate. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU No. 2019-12 is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC Topic 740 related to intra-period tax allocation, simplifies when companies recognize deferred taxes in an interim period, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-08 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements - Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer.” ASU No. 2019-08 amends and clarifies ASU No. 2018-07, which was adopted by the Company on June 1, 2019, to require that an entity measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance in Topic 718. For entities that have already adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2018-07, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04 “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments.” ASU No. 2019-04 was issued as part of the FASB’s ongoing project to improve upon its ASC, and to clarify and improve areas of guidance related to recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement. This guidance contains several effective dates but is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, “Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606.” ASU No. 2018-18 was issued to resolve the diversity in practice concerning the manner in which entities account for transactions based on their assessment of the economics of a collaborative arrangement. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).” ASU No. 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” ASU No. 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” based on the FASB Concepts Statement, “Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting - Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements,” including consideration of costs and benefits. This guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairments.” ASU No. 2017-04 establishes a one-step process for testing goodwill for a decrease in value, requiring a goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The guidance eliminates the second step of the current two-step process that requires the impairment to be measured as the difference between the implied value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the goodwill’s carrying amount. This guidance is effective for public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filers for its annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual impairment tests after January 1, 2017. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020. The Company has completed its assessment of the adoption of this guidance, including changes to internal controls, and it will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU No. 2016-13, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic and commonly referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported financial assets. It also requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. This guidance is effective for public business entities that are U.S. SEC filers for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2020 and will be adopted using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company’s CECL implementation group has completed its evaluation, testing, and validation of the necessary CECL model changes to business processes, systems and controls to support the adoption of the new guidance and record expected credit losses to its accounts receivable, PEO unbilled receivables, and available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities as of June 1, 2020. The ultimate effect of CECL on our credit losses will depend on the size, composition and credit quality of the Company’s accounts receivable and investment portfolios, economic conditions at and subsequent to the date of adoption, as well as any refinements to our model, methodology and other key assumptions. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the FASB ASC), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note B - Service Revenue
Service revenue is primarily attributable to fees for providing services to the Company’s clients and is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to its clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for such services. The Company’s service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenue is recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. The Company’s contracts generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with 30-days’ notice of termination. Sales and other applicable non-payroll related taxes are excluded from service revenue.
Based upon similar operational and economic characteristics, the Company’s service revenue is disaggregated by Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company believes these revenue categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
Management Solutions Revenue
Management Solutions revenue is primarily derived from the Company’s payroll processing, payroll-related ancillary services, and HR outsourcing solutions. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. The Company’s offerings often leverage the information gathered in its base payroll processing service, allowing it to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum. Management Solutions revenue is generally recognized over time as services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.
Revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is also included in Management Solutions revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Delivery service revenue is recognized at a point in time following the delivery of payroll checks, reports, quarter-end packages, and tax returns to the Company’s clients.
PEO and Insurance Solutions Revenue
PEO solutions are sold through the Company’s registered and licensed subsidiaries, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC, Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P. (“Oasis”), and HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (“HROi”), and offer businesses a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. The Company serves as a co-employer of its clients’ employees, offers health insurance coverage to client employees, and assumes the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance and certain health insurance benefit offerings. PEO Solutions revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services. PEO Solutions revenue is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to the Company’s guaranteed cost benefit plans. For guaranteed cost benefit plans where the Company does not retain risk, revenues are recorded net of the premiums paid to the insurance carrier. For workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where the Company retains risk, revenues and costs are recorded on a gross basis.
PEO pass-through costs netted within the PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue are as follows:
Insurance solutions are sold through the Company’s licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., which provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing companies to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, and commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Insurance Solutions revenue reflects commissions earned on insurance services premiums billed and is recognized over time as services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition for Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients as they both occur during the respective client payroll period for which the services are provided. Therefore, the Company does not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing.
Payments received for certain of the Company’s service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers revenue associated with these performance obligations, which exceed one year, and subsequently recognizes these as future services are provided, over approximately three years to four years.
Changes in deferred revenue related to a material right that exceed one year were as follows:
Deferred revenue related to a material right is reported in the deferred revenue and other long-term liabilities line items on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expects to recognize $21.6 million of deferred revenue related to a material right during its fiscal year ending May 31, 2021 and $21.0 million of such deferred revenue thereafter.
Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts
The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. The Company also recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are reported in the prepaid expenses and other current assets and long-term deferred costs line items on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense related to costs to obtain and fulfill a contract are included in cost of service revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Refer to the Note A of this Item 8 for additional disclosures on our policies for assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 or May 31, 2019.
Changes in deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts were as follows:
Note C - Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
Weighted-average common share equivalents that had an anti-dilutive impact are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
In May 2019, the Company announced that its Board approved a program to repurchase up to $400.0 million of its common stock, with authorization expiring on May 31, 2022. During fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares for $171.9 million under this repurchase program. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares for $56.9 million and 2.5 million shares for $143.1 million, respectively, under a previously authorized repurchase program. The purpose of these programs is to manage common stock dilution. All shares of common stock repurchased were retired.
Note D - Business Combinations
Effective December 20, 2018, the Company acquired Oasis. Upon closing, Oasis became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Oasis is an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services. The purchase price was $992.2 million, net of $262.3 million in cash acquired, including $132.1 million of restricted cash. The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of long-term private placement debt totaling $800.0 million.
The results of operations for Oasis have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income since the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2019, Oasis contributed $163.7 million of total revenues and $5.1 million of operating income, including the impact of certain one-time charges related to the acquisition and integration of the Oasis business, in the Company’s consolidated results of operations. The Company incurred $5.3 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with Oasis during fiscal 2019, which was included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” The acquired assets and liabilities of Oasis were recorded at their acquisition-date fair values and were consolidated with those of the Company as of the acquisition date. The purchase accounting was finalized during fiscal 2020.
The following acquisition-date fair values were assigned to the acquired net assets (amounts in millions):
The Company assigned $310.9 million to amortizable intangible assets, including customer lists, trade names and trademarks, and non-compete agreements, with a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 10 years. Goodwill in the amount of $976.6 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is not tax-deductible. Goodwill is attributable to the future economic benefits the Company expects to achieve and expected synergies to be realized when combining the operations of this acquisition into our existing operations.
Pro Forma Financial Results (Unaudited): The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited pro forma operating results for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 as if the acquisition of Oasis had been consummated as of June 1, 2017. The following pro forma information does not include the impact of any costs incurred to integrate Oasis’ operations:
The unaudited pro forma operating results have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and include the acquisition of Oasis adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the determination of fair values of the acquired property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the permanent financing of debt, the elimination of interest income related to available cash used for the acquisition, and the elimination of Oasis’ interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition. In addition, the net income above for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 includes a non-recurring one-time net tax benefit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Since the pro forma financial results assume the acquisition was consummated on June 1, 2017, the unaudited pro forma operating results for fiscal 2019 excluded $2.7 million ($2.0 million, net of tax) of costs incurred by the Company related to the acquisition of Oasis. The unaudited pro forma operating results for fiscal 2018 included $2.7 million ($1.7 million, net of tax) of costs incurred by the Company related to the acquisition of Oasis.
Oasis’ fiscal year end was the Sunday closest to the calendar year end. Since Oasis and the Company had different fiscal year end dates, the unaudited pro forma operating results were prepared based on comparable periods.
The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of June 1, 2017 for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.
Effective February 28, 2018, the Company acquired Lessor Group (“Lessor”). Upon closing, Lessor became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Lessor is a market-leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in Northern Europe. The purchase price was $162.5 million, net of $13.4 million in cash acquired. Goodwill in the amount of $112.3 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is not tax-deductible.
Effective August 18, 2017, the Company acquired HROi and all of its operating subsidiaries. HROi is a national PEO that provides HR solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses in more than 35 states. The acquisition expands the Company’s presence in the PEO industry. The purchase price was $75.4 million and was comprised of $42.2 million of cash plus $33.2 million issued in the form of Paychex common stock. Goodwill in the amount of $51.1 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is not tax-deductible.
The financial results of Lessor and HROi are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Subsequent adjustments made to preliminary opening balance sheet amounts before finalization for these acquisitions were immaterial. The Company concluded that these acquisitions were not material to its results of operations and financial position. Therefore, pro forma financial information has been excluded.
Note E - Other (Expense)/Income, Net
Other (expense)/income, net, consisted of the following items:
Note F - Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective on October 14, 2015 (the “2002 Plan”), authorizes grants of up to 44.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock. As of May 31, 2020, there were 17.3 million shares available for future grants under the 2002 Plan.
All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and an increase in additional paid-in capital.
Stock-based compensation expense was $47.4 million, $46.2 million, and $44.6 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Additional stock-based compensation expense was recognized in fiscal 2018 when the Company decided to maximize its tax benefit by accelerating the vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) into fiscal 2018 that would have otherwise vested in August 2018. Related income tax benefits recognized were $9.0 million, $8.9 million, and $14.5 million for the respective fiscal years.
As of May 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was $65.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
Black-Scholes fair value assumptions: The fair value of stock option grants and performance-based stock option grants was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
No performance-based stock options were granted during fiscal 2020.
Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is based on a combination of historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life, and implied market volatility. The expected option life is based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock options: Stock options entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock options have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Stock option grants to executives and outside directors are typically approved by the Board in July. Grants of stock options to executives vest one-third per annum. Grants to members of the Board vest after one year. Vesting is generally achieved on these dates with active employment or participation as a member of the Board on the date of vesting.
The following table summarizes stock option activity for fiscal 2020:
(1)Total shares valued at the market price of the underlying stock as of May 31, 2020 less the exercise price.
Other information pertaining to stock option grants is as follows:
RSUs: The Board grants RSUs to certain executive and non-executive employees. An RSU is an agreement to issue shares at the time of vesting with no associated exercise cost for the employee. For each unit granted, the holder will receive one share of Paychex common stock at the time of vesting. If the recipient does not vest in the shares due to leaving Paychex, all shares or units of RSUs, and any dividends accrued thereon, when applicable, will be forfeited and returned to the Company. The Company made a decision in fiscal 2018 to accelerate the vesting of the August 2018 tranche into fiscal 2018.
Time-based RSUs: Time-based RSUs granted to non-executives vest one-fifth per annum over five years, while those granted to executives vest one-third per annum over three years. Vesting is generally achieved on these dates with active employment. The fair value of time-based RSUs is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Time-based RSUs may, or may not, earn dividend equivalents depending on the terms of the specific grant.
Performance-based RSUs: Performance-based RSUs primarily have a two-year performance period, after which the number of underlying RSUs earned will be determined based on achievement against pre-established performance targets. The RSUs earned are then subject to a one-year service period. Performance-based RSUs do not earn dividend equivalents during the performance period. The fair value of the RSUs is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the performance period.
The following table summarizes RSU activity for fiscal 2020:
(1)For performance-based RSUs, granted number assumes achievement of performance goals at target. Actual number of shares to be earned may differ from this amount.
Other information pertaining to RSUs is as follows:
(1)Based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(2)No performance-based RSUs were granted during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Restricted stock awards: The Board approves grants of restricted stock awards to the Company’s executives and outside directors. All shares underlying awards of restricted stock are restricted in that they are not transferable until they vest. Recipients of the restricted stock earn dividends, which are paid to the recipient at the time the awards vest. If the recipient does not vest in the shares due to leaving Paychex, all shares of restricted stock, and the dividends accrued thereon, when applicable, will be forfeited and returned to the Company.
Time-based restricted stock awards: Time-based restricted stock awards granted to executives vest one-third per annum. Time-based restricted stock awards granted to outside directors vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is generally achieved on these dates with active employment or participation as a member of the Board on the date of vesting. The fair value of time-based restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant.
Performance-based restricted stock awards: Performance-based restricted stock awards primarily have a two-year performance period, after which the number of shares earned will be determined based on achievement against pre-established performance targets. The restricted shares earned are then subject to a one-year service period. Performance-based shares do not earn dividend equivalents during the performance period. The fair value of performance-based shares is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the performance period.
The following table summarizes time-based and performance-based restricted stock award activity for fiscal 2020:
(1)For performance-based shares, granted number assumes achievement of performance goals at target. Actual number of shares to be earned may differ from this amount.
Other information pertaining to time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards is as follows:
Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”): The Company has two long-term incentive performance-based stock awards under its LTIP. In July 2011, the Board approved a special award of performance-based non-qualified stock options. Subsequent grants of this award were made upon the hire of new executives. Under this award, stock options were granted to executives with vesting dependent on achievement against long-term strategic and financial objectives. Total stock options earned and vested were based on achievement against pre-established targets for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 (”fiscal 2016”). The performance period was completed in fiscal 2016. Although the performance period was completed and the stock options were earned and vested, there are still stock options outstanding as of May 31, 2020.
In July 2016, the Board approved an LTIP award comprised of both performance-based non-qualified stock options and performance-based restricted stock. This award was granted to executives down to the vice president level with vesting dependent on achievement against long-term strategic and financial objectives. Total stock options and restricted shares to be earned are based on achievement against pre-established targets for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes LTIP performance-based stock option activity for fiscal 2020:
(1)Shares valued at the market price of the underlying stock as of May 31, 2020 less the exercise price.
Other information pertaining to LTIP performance-based stock options is as follows:
No performance-based stock options vested in fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.
LTIP performance-based restricted stock do not earn dividend equivalents during the performance period. The fair value of LTIP performance-based restricted stock is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the performance period. If the recipient leaves Paychex prior to the vesting date for any reason, the shares of performance-based restricted stock will be forfeited and returned to the Company.
The following table summarizes LTIP performance-based restricted stock activity for fiscal 2020:
Non-compensatory employee benefit plan: The Company offers a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to all employees. The Company’s common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction at a discount to the market price. The qualified ESPP allows for a discount of up to 15% based on the sole discretion of the committee established to administer the plan. For offering periods during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 the discount was set at 5% of the market price. Transactions under the non-qualified ESPP occurred directly through the Company’s transfer agent and no brokerage fees were charged to employees. Transactions under the qualified ESPP occur through the Company’s third-party stock plan administrator. The plans have been deemed non-compensatory and therefore, no stock-based compensation costs have been recognized for fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018 related to the plan.
Note G - Funds Held for Clients and Corporate Investments
Funds held for clients and corporate investments are as follows:
Included in funds held for clients’ money market securities and other cash equivalents as of May 31, 2020 were bank demand deposit accounts and money market funds.
Included in asset-backed securities as of May 31, 2020 were investment-grade securities primarily collateralized by fixed-rate auto loans and credit card receivables and all have credit ratings of AAA. The primary risk associated with these securities is the collection of the underlying receivables. Collateral on these asset-backed securities has performed as expected through May 31, 2020.
Included in corporate bonds as of May 31, 2020 were investment-grade securities covering a wide range of issuers, industries, and sectors and primarily carry credit ratings of A or better and having maturities ranging from June 2020 through September 2026.
Included in municipal bonds as of May 31, 2020 were general obligation bonds and revenue bonds primarily carrying credit ratings of AA or better and have maturities ranging from June 2020 through September 2027.
A substantial portion of our portfolios are invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The classification of funds held for clients and corporate investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:
Funds held for clients’ money market securities and other cash equivalents is collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and employee payment services and is invested until remitted to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Based upon the Company’s intent and its contractual obligation to clients, these funds are considered restricted until they are remitted to fund these client obligations.
The Company’s available-for-sale securities reflected net unrealized gains of $100.0 million and $19.7 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Included in net unrealized gains as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 were 19 and 269 available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, representing approximately 2% and 28% of the total securities held, respectively. The available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position were as follows:
The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. The Company believes that the investments held as of May 31, 2020 that had gross unrealized losses of $1.7 million were not other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company believes that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms, and that the unrealized losses on these securities were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. Most of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 held an AA rating or better. The Company does not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believes that it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. The Company’s assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments, including developments related to COVID-19, or changes in the Company’s strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were as follows:
The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2020 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
Variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”) are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.
Note H - Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting standards related to fair value measurements include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based on reliability, as follows:
Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 valuations are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability including the following:
quoted prices for similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets;
quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instrument; or
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, when used by the Company, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:
In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company predominately uses the market approach. Money market securities, which are cash equivalents, are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Cash equivalents also include commercial paper which is considered a Level 2 investment as it is valued based on similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets. Available-for-sale securities, including asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government agency and treasury securities, and VRDNs, are included in Level 2 and are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company’s Level 2 available-for-sale securities, the independent pricing service uses a variety of inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service because it believes that they are appropriately valued.
Assets included as other are mutual fund investments, consisting of participants’ eligible deferral contributions under the Company’s non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans. The related liability is reported as other long-term liabilities. The mutual funds are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets.
The Company’s long-term borrowings are accounted for under historical cost. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the fair value of long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs was $441.9 million and $416.6 million for the Senior Notes, Series A, respectively, and $448.7 million and $418.3 million for the Senior Notes, Series B, respectively.
The Company’s long-term borrowings are not traded in active markets and as a result its fair values were estimated using a market approach employing Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available based on loans with similar terms and maturities.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
Note I: Leases
The Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of operating leases for office space and equipment and has remaining terms from less than one year up to ten years, with contractual terms expiring from 2020 to 2030. Lease contracts may include one or more renewal options that allow the Company to extend the lease term, typically from one year to five years per each renewal option. The exercise of lease options is generally at the discretion of the Company. None of the Company’s leases contain residual value guarantees, substantial restrictions, or covenants.

The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:
A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:
The effective income tax rates in all periods were impacted by recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. In fiscal 2019, the effective income tax rate included discrete tax expense for changes in tax reserves and the revaluation of deferred tax balances for legislative updates. In fiscal 2018, as a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a non-recurring net tax benefit for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.
The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to U.S. federal corporate income taxation including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (a blended statutory tax rate of 29.2% for fiscal 2018); (ii) repeal of the Section 199 qualified production activities deduction; (iii) creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of certain officer compensation, interest, meals, entertainment and other expenses; and (iv) changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system. As of May 31, 2019, the Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act was completed.
As a result of the Tax Act, the Company derived estimated tax benefits of $160.5 million, including a net tax benefit of $83.5 million related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities and a net tax benefit of $77.0 million related to the reduction in the Company’s statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 applied to income before taxes. These amounts totaled $0.23 per diluted share and $0.21 per diluted share, respectively.
Uncertain income tax positions: The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, numerous local and state tax jurisdictions within the U.S., and taxes in Europe. The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the total reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was $26.5 million and $21.6 million, respectively, and was included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, not including interest or other potential offsetting effects, is as follows:
In May 2018, the Company settled its IRS examination for fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017. As a result of the settlement, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by $27.2 million and income tax expense of $2.7 million was recorded.
The reserve as of May 31, 2020 substantially relates to the Company’s uncertain tax positions for certain state income tax matters. The Company believes the reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, of $26.5 million as of May 31, 2020 adequately covers open tax years and uncertain tax positions up to and including fiscal 2020 for major taxing jurisdictions. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the entire $26.5 million and $21.6 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and net of federal benefit, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.
The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2017. With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities are closed through fiscal 2014, primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations.
The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was immaterial to the Company’s results of operations.
Note M - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
Reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) are for realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and are reflected in interest on funds held for clients and other (expense)/income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
Note N - Short-term Financing
The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of its normal and recurring business operations. The purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The Company typically borrows on an overnight or short-term basis on its credit facilities.
Details of the Company’s credit facilities are as follows:
(1)JPM acts as the administrative agent for this syndicated credit facility.
(2)This agreement replaced the Company’s predecessor five-year unsecured $1.0 billion credit facility dated August 5, 2015, which was terminated on July 31, 2019.
(3)This agreement replaced the Company’s predecessor four-year unsecured $150.0 million credit facility dated March 17, 2016, which was terminated on February 6, 2020.
(4)The total amount available under these credit facilities as of May 31, 2020 was approximately $1.8 billion. Amounts under the PNC credit facility remain outstanding as of the date of this report.
Subsequent to May 31, 2020, the Company borrowed twice on an overnight basis, $89.5 million on a weighted-average basis under its PNC credit facility.
Upon the expiration date of any credit facility, any borrowings outstanding under that facility will mature and be payable on such date.
Interest rates on each of the Company’s credit facilities can be based upon (1) an alternate base rate that is established by the lending institution at the highest of several publicly available interest rates, plus an applicable interest rate margin, or (2) at our election, the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or an alternate interest rate as determined by the administrative agent, plus an applicable interest rate margin. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee, ranging from 0.05% to 0.15%, related to the unutilized portion of each credit facility. The commitment fee is determined on a sliding-scale basis based upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio.
Obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The credit facilities contain financial and operational covenants with which the Company must maintain compliance. The Company’s ability to borrow under the credit facilities may be restricted in the event of certain covenant breaches or events of default. In addition, the terms of the credit facilities could restrict the Company’s ability to engage in certain business transactions. The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of May 31, 2020.
Certain lenders under these credit facilities, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for the Company, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will continue to receive in the future, customary fees and expenses.
Letters of credit: The Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $147.9 million and $148.9 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between June 2020 and January 2022. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019, or as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019. Subsequent to May 31, 2020, letters of credit expiring in June and July 2020 were renewed through June and July 2021, respectively.
Note O - Long-term Financing
On March 13, 2019, the Company and its Paychex of New York LLC (“PoNY”) subsidiary completed the private placement of Senior Notes, Series A in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million due on March 13, 2026, and Senior Notes, Series B in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million due on March 13, 2029 (collectively the “Notes”), pursuant to its Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the “Agreement”) among the Company, PoNY, and the respective purchasers. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off $800.0 million in short-term borrowings under the Company’s JPM credit facilities used to temporarily finance the acquisition of Oasis.
Long-term debt, at amortized cost, consisted of the following:
Certain information related to the Senior Notes for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 are as follows:
The effective interest rates for each note series includes the interest on the note and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Payment of all amounts due with respect to the Notes and performance under the Agreement is guaranteed by the Company, PoNY and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The Company may, at its option, prepay at any time all, or any part of, the Notes, subject to certain conditions as described in the Agreement.
The Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements. The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of May 31, 2020.
Note P - Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Income taxes paid were $298.8 million, $317.9 million, and $319.1 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Interest expense paid was $38.0 million, $10.4 million, and $4.0 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
$33.2 million in Paychex common stock was issued in connection with the Company’s acquisition of HROi in fiscal 2018.
Note Q - Employee Benefit Plans
401(k) plan: The Company maintains a contributory savings plan that qualifies under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of 50% of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Employees who have completed one year of service and a minimum of 1,000 hours worked are eligible to receive a Company matching contribution, when such contribution is in effect. The Company provided a matching contribution of 50% of up to 8% of eligible pay that an employee contributed to the Plan through March 29, 2018. Beginning March 30, 2018, the Company provides a matching contribution of 100% of the first 3% and 50% on the next 2% of eligible pay for a total matching contribution of 4%. Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $30.1 million, $29.3 million, and $23.6 million, respectively.
The Plan is 100% participant directed. Plan participants can fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan Stock Fund, are not restricted, with the exception of certain restricted trading periods for individuals designated as insiders as specified in the Company’s Insider Trading Policy. The Company match contribution, when in effect, follows the same fund elections as the employee compensation deferrals.
Deferred compensation plans: The Company and certain subsidiaries offer non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers, and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus and outside directors may defer 100% of their Board cash compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the participant’s election of a variety of investment choices. The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee its return. Distributions are paid at one of the following dates selected by the participant: the participant’s termination date, the date the participant retires from any active employment, or a designated specific date. The amounts accrued under these plans were $26.8 million and $27.0 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note R - Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies: The Company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, employment-related claims, tax claims, patent, statutory, and other matters.
The Company’s management currently believes that resolution of any outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Other commitments: As of May 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding commitments under purchase orders, legally binding contractual arrangements, and commitments under existing workers’ compensation insurance agreements with minimum future payment obligations of approximately $306.6 million, including $5.0 million of commitments to purchase capital assets. These minimum future payment obligations relate to the following fiscal years:
In the normal course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they relate to their services provided to the Company.
The Company currently self-insures the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee benefit plans. The Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2020. The Company also maintains insurance coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its captive insurance company.

During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 thorough 2015 the Company acquired various projects and corporate entities across various industry sectors in an effort to commence revenue generating operations. As a result of the transition in business focus, management teams and controlling shareholders over these fiscal periods, the Company changed its name from Pristine Solutions Inc. to Eaton Scientific Systems Inc. effective November 27, 2012, and subsequently to Eco Science Solutions, Inc. during February 2014, in order to better reflect its evolving business operations. The Company effected a 1000-to-1 reverse stock split in February 2014.
On December 15, 2015, our current management, Mr. Jeffery Taylor and to Mr. Don Taylor became the controlling shareholders of the Company and continue to control approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares.
Effective December 17, 2015, Mr. Jeffery Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Mr. Don Lee Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Upon this change in control, the direction of business turned to a focus on eco-friendly products and related businesses. Between 2015 and 2017 the Company worked to develop certain apps known as Herbo and Fitrix for introduction to the marketplace.
The Fitrix app is a powerful and flexible companion, which helps users keep track of your day-to-day fitness routines, dietary habits and alternative medicine intake. Fitrix users can measure and track anything and everything when it comes to their health and wellness. One can track the accomplishment of custom created goals, monitor dietary, exercise and alternative medication schedules, be notified of important milestones, establish timelines to develop effective habits ... all leveraging a unique notebook and calendar. During fiscal 2020, the Company determined to cease support of the Fitrix app in favour of its Herbo app and suite of enterprise software.
The Herbo apps include a database of over 14,000 alternative medicine locations and delivery services, doctors who provide evaluations, and local shops that sell relevant product. The Herbo app helps consumers find products and services that support the intake of alternative medicines for a more naturopathic way of living. Expansions to Herbo over the most recent fiscal years include Herbo For Consumers, Herbo for Business and Herbo for Drivers.
During fiscal 2018 ESSI acquired 100% of the shares of capital stock of Ga-Du Corporation (“Ga-Du”), at which time Ga-Du became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Concurrent
with the transaction, on June 21, 2017, Mr. John Lewis and Mr. S. Randall Overson joined the Board of directors of ESSI. Ga-Du offers a Financial Services Platform, as well as Inventory Control and Advisory Software Platforms, and Retail Inventory Control, bringing important enterprise technologies in-house and bringing ESSI an opportunity to expand the reach of its Herbo branding. Subsequently Ga-Du Corporation entered into an Assignment Agreement with G&L Enterprises, wherein G&L Enterprises assigned to Ga-Du Corporation, all of its rights, interest in, and obligations under a License and Master Marketing Agreement (LMMA) it entered into with Alliance Financial Network, Inc. (""AFN"").
AFN provides financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals, including the cannabis industry, on a programmatic or membership basis from which AFN derives fees and income from enrolling companies in their financial program and providing a range of services, with respect to which AFN and Ga-Du derive fees and income on a fee based schedule.
The primary focus of AFN is a mobile application known as eXPO™ electronic eXchange Portal which provides virtual financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals that are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and/or require more intensive compliance than banks are willing, or able to perform and/or do not have the technical expertise or financial wherewithal in house to develop their own FinTech solutions, including accounting and enterprise management software. One such industry is the cannabis industry where AFN establishes Membership relationships with businesses in this industry, following a full compliance audit on the business. These services utilize the Herbo suite of software to effectively track transactional data for eXPO™ users, providing Ga-Du a share of all Cannabis related revenues received by AFN regardless of the source of revenues through (i) membership fees; (ii) cash depository fees; (iii) merchant processing and credit card fees; (iv) transfer fees; and (v) advertising fees. AFN’s services operate on a national level with sales in both cannabis and non-cannabis based industries. While revenues allocated to Ga-Du are currently governed on a territory by territory basis, Ga-Du and AFN are actively negotiating an amendment to the agreements to become all inclusive.
In exchange for the revenue split under the LMMA, as amended in March 2018, Ga-Du agreed to pay to AFN $405,000 in three tranches for operational expenses and business development.
Under the terms of the aforementioned agreements with respect to a beta trial for the AFN services focused solely on the State of Colorado during the period May through October 31, 2018, $28,431 is payable to Ga-Du from revenue generated by operations on the eXPOTM platform. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021.
During February 2019 the Company determined to focus on the growth of its Herbo branding with the development of an easy-to-use enterprise software that allows clients to simplify their processes, remain compliant, and enjoy steady growth. We engaged a third party to provide development services relative to a suite of software for managing operations including accounting, inventory control and management, data management, reporting and compliance, lead generation and marketing, CRM sales management and certain other key functions.
On March 1, 2019 the Company and Haiku Holdings LLC ""Haiku"", a company controlled by our COO, Mike Rountree, entered into a Trademark Licensing Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Licensed Marks, including and incorporating Herbo, may be used by Haiku to facilitate the Company's business including lead generation and referral services. Further, as a result of any revenue generating business generated by Haiku, the Company shall receive 90% of the net revenue. The license remains in effect for a period of ten (10) years from the effective date of the agreement and may be terminated on sixty (60) days written notice by the Company should there be a material breach which remains uncured, or at any time on ten (10) days written notice by Haiku without cause.
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company (“Reseller”) entered into a Software Reseller Agreement with respect to the Herbo suite of software offerings with Haiku (“Licensor”). Licensor is the owner of certain computer software-as-a-service offerings and related documentation that it provides to end users. Under the terms of the agreement, the Reseller desires (a) a non-exclusive license of the Software and (b) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable and limited right and license to reproduce, market, and distribute such Software, and Licensor agrees to grant to Reseller such right and license. Under the terms of the agreement for each respective End User License Agreement (EULA) entered into with an End User, Reseller shall pay Licensor the corresponding license fee for the software usage of 10% of gross receipts from End Users. Fees are due on or prior to the 15th day of each calendar month in respect of all gross receipts received from End Users during the previous calendar month.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 the company recorded $5,973 as license fees payable to Haiku under costs of sales as a result of gross revenues generated from software sales of $59,729.
Current Business and Strategy
Our business operations commenced generating modest revenues subsequent to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and up to the period ended October 31, 2018, when the initial phase of our eXPOTM beta revenue model testing were complete. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020 we took steps to shift our focus to monetizing our Herbo branded apps and recently developed enterprise software to assist companies in the cannabis industry to simplify their processes, remain compliant, and enjoy steady growth. Under the terms of our licensing agreements with Haiku we commenced generating revenues from licensing of our software during the current fiscal year and continue to seek expansion of this growing area of operation.

Operations of Ga-Du
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Ga-Du, acquired in June 2017, offers the following suite of business functions and opportunities:
Financial Services Platform Summary
Ga-Du has developed multiple financial services applications. It has created a software platform that captures individual and business entity data. Ga-Du platform is a secure portal for account access and features incorporating current banking standards for operating and securing online data. In terms of Financial Services, the Ga-Du platform uses a strict and proprietary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process, this ensures compliance regardless of the underlying usage. This software can be used for membership capture, registrations of various kinds, for customer accounts retention and marketing, and/or for bank accounts. In addition, the Ga-Du banking platform has been enhanced for mobile devices. The mobile payment platform accommodates the purchasing of products and services like those offered by ESSI, and/or a combined entity, as well as other products and services both inside and outside the cannabis industry. By targeting digital customers rather than brick-and-mortar customers, the digital Ga-Du platform acquired by ESSI is ready to provide banking services to any underserved area.
Inventory Control and Advisory Systems Business Summary
Retail marijuana is arguably the fastest growing segment of the cannabis industry. National monthly sales numbers seem to demonstrate, average year-over-year increases of over 100% for some years following legalization. However, cannabis retailers still face hurdles finding working capital due to the federal regulation of cannabis as a Schedule I drug. This lack of capital results in a potential market disruption opportunity. Because businesses have not had financial resources to develop their own effective business solutions of various kinds, they represent potential ""soft targets"" for Ga-Du software and enterprise processes for inventory control and other services. ESSI, through its acquisition of Ga-Du Corporation, will make available its Ga-Du solutions, advisory services, and inventory control systems (from raw materials to finished product) directly to licensed retail businesses, as well as work-flow analysis and management. Ga-Du has an experienced retail management team which has put in place similar as well as other services systems and processes for inventory acquisition and control. These systems and processes can be licensed to regulate marijuana retail businesses potentially, allowing the retail business to focus on the customer experience while letting ESSI provide the backend technology and systems. The Ga-Du Management team believes that combining the business customer network of ESSI with the technology and systems that Ga-Du has assembled, in a manner that can allow retail businesses rapid access to cutting-edge technology and retail-marijuana-specific inventory control solutions, may provide ESSI with an edge in the rapidly expanding area of cannabis advisory/business services.
Master marketing agreement and AFN
Through our executed LMMA between Ga-Du and AFN, Ga-Du has the exclusive right to undertake marketing responsibilities of AFN's eXPOTM platform to businesses globally for CBD, Hemp and Cannabis, provided that such sales do not include Cannabis sales which have not been legalized by that territory’s laws.
AFN is registered with FinCEN (MSB Registration Number: 31000094744769) as a non-financial services institution, compliant with the AML/BSA guidelines of FinCEN, and is regulated by the IRS. Operating a mobile application known as eXPO™ electronic eXchange Portal, AFN provides financial and marketing services to businesses and individuals, which are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and generally are those that require more intensive compliance then banks are willing, or able to perform. One such industry is the cannabis industry; however the portal has application to various other industry segments. AFN is configured to establish Membership relationships with businesses in this industry following a full compliance audit on the business, where applicable, allowing licensed cannabis businesses and other clients an automated tax payment system and Internet banking services including wire transfers, ACH, electronic checks, armored pickup of cash, and bill pay, payroll services, and inventory control ""seed to ""CPA"". AFN has partnered with our enterprise software suite “Herbo” to augment its services with an enterprise software bundle offering extended services such as business accounting, business insurance, director insurance, employee payroll, inventory system, and credit/debit card management. Additionally, the AFN automated tax payment system can calculate and deliver state tax payments within 48hrs after the funds are made available in a taxpayer's account. The AFN eXPO™ solution is a federally registered solution in the United States which incorporates an in-depth anti-laundering and ""Know Your Customer"" process, ensuring compliance with the Cole memo and all federal and state regulations. Further bundled into this software solution is the ""seed to CPA"" accounting system, which provides a frugal and efficient way for businesses to report and manage their finances. In terms of tax collection, account services, and business features, this software is unparalleled at providing fast, compliant, and traceable cash management solutions.
Under the agreements, AFN will provide all software platform(s) necessary to deliver the Financial Services, assure compliance with appropriate Federal Requirements and international money laundering restrictions, administer all compliance, enrollment, and collection of fees from the Members contracting with AFN, provide any and all necessary marketing or other materials describing AFN's services and program, will forward any required Sales Commissions to the appropriate recipients, and assure adequate customer service at all times.
AFN will be responsible for the functional operation of any software utilized in providing its services and for the administration and handling of monies and/or any credits relating thereto and, in the event of any claim, cause of action or lawsuit (together the ""Claims"") for failure to properly administer such responsibilities, AFN shall have the sole obligation to defend such Claim(s) and shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ga-Du from and against such Claims.
AFN will maintain accounting and data concerning the income from the Cannabis Industry and will generate a monthly income statement as to each of the following revenue streams: (i) membership fees; (ii) cash depository fees; (iii) merchant processing and credit card fees; (iv) transfer fees; and (v) advertising fees.
AFN and Ga-Du split compensation derived from income generated from enrollees of Ga-Du according to a fee schedule established for each level of business relationship. As noted above, while the revenue sharing agreement is currently based on territory, AFN and GA-Du are currently re-negotiating to include all service areas.
During fiscal 2019 we completed a beta program restricted to the State of Colorado whereby we generated revenues between May and October 2018 under this business segment and while initial revenue sharing was modest, we expect this segment to become a viable revenue stream in the Company's portfolio during fiscal 2021. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations.

The Company's consumer initiatives are currently centered on education and connecting consumers with various cannabis and CBD hemp businesses. Its enterprise initiatives are focused on developing technology and accounting solutions, coupled with data analytics to help businesses to be more effective in their abilities to connect, market, and sell to consumers.

Intellectual Property
The Company has registered and has in process applications for certain Herbo trademarks. There is no other intellectual property.
Government Regulations
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. Although they have not done so, the current administration could decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. See Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement discussed below. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could impact our planned business operation. Because the business activities of businesses, engaged in the medicinal cannabis industry, that we may direct our customers is illegal under federal law, we may be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the location services that we provide to our customers, relative to the cannabis industry. As a result, we may be subject to actions by law enforcement authorities, which would materially and adversely affect our business. Legislation is currently pending in the U.S. Congress which would reclassify cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3. If enacted into law, such change could provide a material benefit to businesses engaged in the cultivation and sale of cannabis, including eligibility for federal tax deductions, access to the banking system and generally de-criminalizing the use or sale of cannabis where it is legal under applicable state laws.
The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry, in particular, recreational marijuana. While we do not directly engage in the sale or cultivation of cannabis, changes in laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business and financial condition.
Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement
Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents which would include the so called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, the Attorney General directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The DOJ asserts this return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs.
On April 13, 2018 it was announced that President Donald Trump had promised Senate Republican Cory Gardner that he will support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized marijuana, defusing a months-long standoff between Sen. Cory Gardner and the administration over Justice Department nominees. Trump told Gardner that despite the DOJ memo of January 4, 2018, the marijuana industry in Colorado will not be targeted. A bill has not been finalized, but discussion has commenced to find legislation that would, in effect, make clear the federal government cannot interfere with states that have voted to legalize marijuana.(1)

Industrial Hemp
Industrial hemp is now legal in the U.S., which advocates hope could eventually loosen laws around the popular marijuana extract CBD.
The 2018 farm bill which legalized hemp including a variety of cannabis that does not produce the psychoactive component of marijuana, paved the way to legitimacy for an agricultural sector that has been operating on the fringe of the law. Industrial hemp has made investors and executives swoon because of the potential multibillion-dollar market for cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-psychoactive compound that has started to turn up in beverages, health products and pet snacks, among other products.
Currently, it appears that CBD will remain largely off-limits for ingestible products. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement saying that despite the new status of hemp, CBD is still considered a drug ingredient and remains illegal to add to food or health products without the agency’s approval, disappointing many hemp advocates, who said they will continue to work to convince the FDA to loosen its CBD rules. The FDA said some hemp ingredients, such as hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil, are safe in food and won’t require additional approvals.
The farm bill places industrial hemp, which is defined as a cannabis plant with under 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, under the supervision of the Agriculture Department and removes CBD from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, which covers marijuana. The law also “explicitly” preserved the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis, or cannabis-derived compounds.

The Amended Hawaii Complaint arises out of alleged materially false and misleading statements or omissions from SEC filings and/or public statements by or on behalf of the Company. The Amended Hawaii Complaint asserts claims on behalf of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty against the Taylors and Mr. Lewis and Mr. Oveson, for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Oveson, for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against Mr. Giguiere, for waste of corporate assets against the Individual Defendants, and for unjust enrichment against the Individual Defendants. The Amended Hawaii Complaint seeks damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting, waste and unjust enrichment, demands restitution and disgorgement and requests an order directing the Company and all individual defendants to take all necessary actions to reform and improve the Company's corporate governance in order to avoid any alleged future harm to the Company. The Parties have agreed to mediate the potential resolution of all claims with U.S. Magistrate Judge Wes R. Porter on December 3, 2019 in Honolulu. The Parties have agreed to continue their settlement discussions, which are ongoing, in good faith. There is no guarantee that the claims will be settled.
(3) On November 3, 2017, a purported shareholder of the Company, Mr. Hans Menos, filed a verified shareholder derivative complaint against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada (the ""Nevada Federal Complaint""). Mr. Menos amended the Nevada Federal Complaint on December 21, 2018. The Company is identified as a nominal defendant, against which no claims are plead. The Nevada Federal Complaint arises out of alleged materially false and misleading statements or omissions from SEC filings and/or public statements by or on behalf of Company. The Nevada Federal Complaint asserts claims on behalf of the Company for breach of fiduciary duties against the Individual Defendants, for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against Mr. Giguiere, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Oveson, unjust enrichment against the Individual Defendants, waste of corporate assets against the Individual Defendants, abuse of control against the Individual Defendants, and gross mismanagement against the Individual Defendants. The Nevada Federal Complaint (I) seeks judicial declarations that (i) Mr. Menos may maintain this action on behalf of the Company and (ii) the Individual Defendants have breached and/or aided and abetted the breach of their fiduciary duties to the Company; (2) seeks damages to the Company allegedly sustained as a result of the acts/omissions of the Individual Defendants; (3) seeks an order directing the Company and the Individual Defendants to take all necessary actions to reform and improve the Company's corporate governance in order to avoid any alleged future harm to the Company. On March 2, 2020, the parties to the Nevada Federal Complaint stipulated to the dismissal thereof, which the Court approved on March 3, 2020.
(4) On February 1, 2019, the lead plaintiff, Mr. Richard Raschke, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed an amended consolidated class action complaint against the Company, the Taylors, and Mr. Gannon Giguiere in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the ""Class Action""). The Class Action arises out of alleged materially false and misleading statements or omissions from SEC filings and/or public statements by or on behalf of Company. The Class Action asserts claims against all defendants for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Act""), violation of Section 20(a) of the Act against the Taylors and Giguiere and Violation of Section 20(b) against Mr. Giguiere. The Class Action seeks (1) certification of the purported class of plaintiffs, (2) compensatory damages in favor of the class and (3) an award of reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants have moved to stay this action. By consent of the parties, the Court has agreed to suspend this matter pending resolution of the consolidated derivative action in Hawaii.
(5) Although the following lawsuit was not filed against the Company or any of its officers or directors, it nonetheless has a huge impact on the Company. On July 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") filed a Complaint against Gannon Giguiere (""Giguiere""), president of Phenix Ventures, LLC and the Company's largest outside funder. The Complaint alleges Mr. Giguiere's involvement in certain activities, of which the Company, its' officers, board members, and others directly involved with the Company, have no knowledge of. The Complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief. On October 24, 2018, the Court granted the U.S. Government's motion to intervene in the proceedings and stay the action pending resolution of parallel criminal proceedings (described below). Pursuant to the Complaint being filed, the Company continues to seek funding elsewhere as it requires outside funding until it generates more consistent revenue. The Company previously filed an S-1 Registration Statement whereby Phenix would fund the Company in exchange for shares of common stock, and upon Put Notices; to date, there have been no Put Notices and no funds from Phenix Ventures have been distributed to the Company under the registration statement - no shares have been issued pursuant to the Registration Statement.
(6) On June 29, 2018, the United States Government filed an indictment as to Gannon Giguiere in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. In a Superseding Indictment, filed on January 25, 2019, the United States alleges that the defendant engaged in a scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of two penny stock issuers, including ESSI. The United States claims that Mr. Giguiere is guilty of (1) conspiracy to commit securities fraud and manipulative trading and (2) securities fraud. On April 22, 2019, Mr. Giguiere entered a plea of not guilty to each of the counts against him in the Superseding Indictment. On July 23, 2019, defendant entered into a Plea Agreement (the “Plea”) with the Government wherein defendant plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy. Under the Plea, the Government agreed to dismiss and to not prosecute in the future, the remaining charges including, but not limited to, all charges relating to ESSI when defendant is sentenced. The sentencing hearing is currently set for September 21, 2020.
(7) On September 10, 2018 the Company received a Letter of Summons and Notice of Complaint from Wendy Maguire, Vice President of Business Development for Ga Du Corporation, filed in the United States District Court from the Western District of Washington on September 4, 2018 and naming the Company, its subsidiary Ga Du Corporation and two of the Company's officers as Defendants. The Claims filed under the Complaint include payment of accrued and unpaid wages, legal fees and damages. The Company has filed its Answer. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on March 14, 2019 on her statutory claim for unpaid wages and on her claim for breach of employment contract. The motion has been fully briefed. On May 13, 2020, plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to the personal liability of corporate officers of ESSI and Ga-Du under the Washington Wage Rebate Act was Granted. Corporate officers of ESSI and its subsidiary Ga-Du are jointly and severally liable (along with ESSI and its wholly-owned subsidiary Ga-Du) for $240,000 in unpaid wages, another $240,000 in exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest. Defendants’ cross-motions regarding personal liability was denied.
The Company is vigorously defending all of the aforementioned lawsuits where the action has yet to be adjudicated, dismissed or judgement entered. The successful defense of any of the outstanding lawsuits is undeterminable at this time, as are the extent of any possible damages.
Other than as set out above, the Company knows of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against it, nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which its director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to its interest.

MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
Market Information
Our Company commenced quotation on the OTC Markets on September 14, 2010. From September 14, 2010, through May 3, 2013, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Markets under the name ""Pristine Solutions, Inc."" From May 3, 2013, until February 18, 2014, our Company was quoted on the OTC Markets under the name ""Eaton Scientific Systems, Inc."" From February 18, 2014, to February 2017, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Pink Markets under the name ""Eco Science Solutions, Inc. and under the symbol ""ESSI""; from February 2017 to May 2017 our Company was quoted on the OTCMarkets: QB under the symbol ""ESSI"". During May 2017 the trading of ESSI shares on the public exchanges was suspended, and although the suspension has been lifted, a Form 15c2-11 with current information must be filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) prior to the caveat emptor status being lifted. At that time we will need to re-apply to be quoted on the OTCMarkets: QB.
The following table sets forth, for the quarters indicated, the high and low closing bid prices per share of our common stock on Yahoo Finance, reported by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Composite Feed or other qualified interdealer quotation medium. Such quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.
The Company's common stock is subject to rules adopted by the Commission regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in ""penny stocks."" Those disclosure rules applicable to ""penny stocks"" require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a ""penny stock"" not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized list disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in ""penny stocks"" can be very risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in ""penny stocks,"" to independently investigate the security, as well as the salesperson with whom the investor is working and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the ""penny stock"" is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Further, the rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities.
These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for its common stock. Many brokers may be unwilling to engage in transactions in its common stock because of the added disclosure requirements, thereby making it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their shares.
On June 24, 2020, the last reported sales price of our common stock as reported by Yahoo Finance was $0.03

Equity Compensation Plan Information
On September 1, 2012, the board of directors of the Company adopted the 2012 Employee Stock Option Plan (the ""2012 Plan""). Under the 2012 Plan, 25,000,000 restricted shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted from time to time under the stock option plan. The 2012 Plan is intended to assist the Company in securing and retaining key employees, directors and consultants by allowing them to participate in the Company's ownership and growth through the grant of incentive and non-qualified options. Under the 2012 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options only to key employees and employee directors, or the Company may grant non-qualified options to employees, officers, directors and consultants. Subject to the provisions of the 2012 Plan, the board of directors will determine who shall receive options, and the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the options.
As of January 31, 2016, the Company had granted a total of 6,500,000 options to purchase common shares under this plan. In connection with the options granted, a total of $2,665,000 has been recorded as deferred compensation and was expensed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 and prior.

As at January 31, 2017 there are no options outstanding under the 2012 Employee Stock Option Plan.
On January 1, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The purpose of this Plan is to attract, retain and motivate the officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as well as provide a means of compensation for consultants, and to promote the success of the Company's business by providing them with appropriate incentives and rewards either through a proprietary interest in the long-term success of the Company or compensation based on fulfilling certain performance goals.
The Plan shall become effective and Awards may be granted on and after January 1, 2016 (the ""Effective Date""). Any Awards of incentive stock options granted under the Plan are granted subject to approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the Effective Date.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the year ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report.
The Company's consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Overview of Current Operations
Results of Operations for the years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has generated $59,729 and $0 in total revenue. During fiscal 2020 revenues include $6,894 of revenue generated from related parties. We entered into amendments to certain licensing and marketing agreements subsequent to fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 which provide for fee-based income calculated retroactively between March and October 2018 as a result of certain beta trials with respect to the eXPOTM platform, as at January 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts generated from this agreement have not been received by the Company and therefore while revenue has been generated, no revenue has been recorded in our financial statements. We intend to record the revenue attributable to the Company of $28,431 upon receipt.
Costs of revenue totaled $36,329 and $0 in fiscal 2020 and 2019.
As at January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $59,310 and $148,569 in cash and total current assets.
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred total operating expenses of $1,557,564 and $4,208,201, respectively, including costs of sales of $36,329 in fiscal 2020 with no similar expense in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded depreciation and impairment of $4,423 and $367,391 respectively, with 2019 results including the impairment of certain amounts expended on software development during the year, with no impairment expense in fiscal 2019. Amounts expended on advertising and marketing reflect a reduction in expenses year over year from $942,021 (2019) to $49,099 in fiscal 2020. The majority of the expense in 2019 included costs associated with the introduction its Herbo enterprise software and Herbo app on various media, including iOS and Android and other marketing initiatives including promotional expenses for various public venues and sponsorship fees, with no recurring charges in fiscal 2020. Amounts expended on management and consulting fees were also reduced from $1,287,333 (2019) to $785,541 as several management contracts were not renewed on expiry during the current fiscal year. Amounts incurred for accounting, audit and legal fees decreased period over period as a result of a decline in legal costs from $707,135 in fiscal 2019 to only $425,741 in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020 and 2019 research and development fees incurred were $157,837 and $657,948 respectively. Costs for research and development were reduced as the Company completed commercialization of its enterprise software platform “Herbo”. Other operating and general and administrative expenses were reduced year over year from $246,353 in 2019 to $98,594 in fiscal 2020 relative to amounts paid to maintain our public listing, rent, travel and other costs.
The Company recorded interest expense of $249,962 and $586,702 in respect of certain convertible notes and other loan agreements, respectively during fiscal 2020 and 2019, including amortization of debt discount of $371,969 during fiscal 2019, with no similar expense in the current fiscal year. During fiscal 2020 the Company recorded bad debt of $127,833 with respect to a loan receivable which remained uncollected with no comparable expense if fiscal 2019. Interest income recorded in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled $9,000 and $12,000, respectively.
The net loss in fiscal 2020 totaled $1,866,630 as compared to $4,782,903 in fiscal 2019.
The Company used net cash in operations of $787,142 and $2,416,138 respectively during the twelve-month periods ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, recorded $Nil in both years as net cash used for investing activities and received cash from financing activities of $788,410 and $2,415,645, predominantly as a result of certain notes payable, as well as proceeds from related party loans.
Plan of Operation
The Company changed the focus of its business at the close of fiscal 2016 to operate in the eco friendly technology sector using social media sites and offering apps to generate advertising revenues and download fees, and to development certain enterprise software for the cannabis industry. During fiscal 2017 the Company laid the groundwork for income generation from these services by investing in ongoing development of its applications, websites and visibility in both the local and global market. The Company has invested heavily in advertising to allow its applications and ecommerce website visibility on a global stage. During fiscal 2018 we further added to our business portfolio with the acquisition of Ga-Du corporation and the entry into a licensing and marketing agreement that should see the Company generating revenues future fiscal periods. A series of beta tests on the eXPOTM platform between March and October 2018 generated revenues of $28,431 for ESSI which will be recorded upon receipt from AFN. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021.
Fiscal 2020 brought our first revenues from our Herbo enterprise software and we expect to see increasing revenues from this suite of services as we focus on marketing to a larger client base. The Company's need for ongoing capital by way of loans, sale of equity and/or convertible notes is expected to continue during the current fiscal year until we can establish substantive revenues from operations to cover all operational overhead. We have also had to rely heavily on loans from related parties in our most recently completed fiscal year as we work to have our shares returned for quotation to the OTCMarkets QB. There are no assurances additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or that this equity line will be available to us when needed.
Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future funding might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As at January 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $11,247,723 and an accumulated deficit of $73,048,082. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on the Company going forward. COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may severely impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and to pursue certain planned business activities. The Company may be required to cease operations if it is unable to finance its’ operations. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report and is highly uncertain and subject to change. Management is actively monitoring the situation but given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to meet its obligations, raise funds or continue to implement its planned business objectives to obtain profitable operations.
The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2019, the Company had total current assets of $59,310, and total current liabilities of $11,307,033. The Company has limited financial resources available outside loans from its officers and directors and funds it has obtained through use of convertible notes and loans from related parties. While the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement to sell up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock (Ref: Note 12(b)) to the financial statements contained herein) we have been unable to obtain any funding under this agreement in the most recently completed fiscal year. There can be no guarantee the Company will receive proceeds from loans, related party advances or convertible notes sufficient to meet its ongoing operational overheads. While we generated modest revenue in fiscal 2020, we do not yet have resources to meet our operational shortfalls. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. As noted, additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other available funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. During the most recently completed fiscal year management has obtained additional funding with success, however there is no guarantee we will be able to continue to obtain financing if and when required. The current economic downturn may make it difficult to find new capital sources for the Company should they be required.
Future Financings
We anticipate continuing to rely on related party and third-party loans and equity sales of our common shares and/or shares for services rendered in order to continue to fund our business operations in the event of ongoing operational shortfalls. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our research and development activities.
Revenue
While the Company has entered into an LMMA (re: Note 6 to the financial statements contained herein) under which we are entitled to fee-based revenue on a profit-sharing basis from a financial services platform known as eXPOTM, the Company has determined that when recording its revenue, the monthly income is not clearly determinable until the fees are actually paid to the Company by AFN. As at October 31, 2018 fees payable by AFN for the period March 2018 through October 2018 as reconciled in commission reports received from AFN have not been received by the Company. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021. Because of this, the Company has determined to record its revenue in respect to the LMMA upon receipt. In the future, should the fee structure and reporting process become more easily determinable, the recognition method may change. Pursuant to AFN's revenue reports, the amount payable to Ga-Du Corporation is $28,431 (10% of net revenue generated by Colorado Business) January 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company will record the revenue once we receive the proceeds.
During fiscal 2020 we commenced operation of our Herbo enterprise software suite. The Herbo enterprise software is a customizable, all-in-one business software (SaaS) and resource for businesses in the Cannabis and Hemp industries. Herbo provides the software, custom web development, operational training and support needed to plan and manage your Marijuana or CBD business. During fiscal 2020 we recorded gross revenues of $59,729 in respect to the licensing of the software.
Cost of Revenue
Costs of revenue consist of the direct expenses incurred to generate revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue will consist consists primarily of fees associated with the operation of our social media venues and fulfillment of specific customer advertising campaigns related to our downloadable apps as well as commissions and operational charges related to our Herbo enterprise software. During fiscal 2020 we incurred costs of sales of $36,329 with respect to the licensing of our Herbo software suite. In the case of revenue earned by our wholly owned subsidiary, proceeds allocated to our revenue interest are net of associated costs.

The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. The Company believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company's financial statements is critical to an understanding of its consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Advertising and Marketing Costs
Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and were $49,099 during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 and $942,021 in the same period ended January 31, 2019. Advertising and marketing costs include ad placement and click through programs placed on a wide network of mediums acquired from advertising consolidators including Outbrain, MGID, Rev Content, Yahoo, MSN, AOL, Google and others for the full scope of the Company's brands including the Herbo app and enterprise software for all platforms, GooglePlay, iOS, Android, as well as the corporate e-commence site and all the other underlying supporting social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Further the Company incurs other advertising expense in respect to its attendance at various venues to promote our business objectives.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from licensing agreements and contracts by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured.
$59,729 has been recognized as revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, with $0 revenue in the same period ended January 31, 2019. Revenue generated under enterprise software licenses will be recorded in accordance with the terms of the individual Customer contracts. We expect license fees will be recorded on a monthly basis over the term of the contract, activation fees will be earned upon completion of set up and installation of the enterprise software, and customization and/or professional consulting services will be earned as rendered.
While the Company has entered into an LMMA (re: Note 6) under which we are entitled to fee-based revenue on a profit-sharing basis from a financial services platform known as eXPOTM, the Company has determined that when recording its revenue, the monthly income is not clearly determinable until the fees are actually paid to the Company by AFN. As at October 31, 2018 fees payable by AFN for the period May through October 2018 as reconciled in commission reports received from AFN have not been received by the Company. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021. The Company has determined to record its revenue in respect to the LMMA upon receipt until such time as the fee structure and reporting process become more easily determinable. Pursuant to AFN's revenue reports, the amount payable to Ga-Du Corporation is $28,431 (10% of net revenue generated by Colorado Business) at January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019. The Company will record the revenue once we receive the proceeds.
Cost of Revenue
Costs of revenue consist of the direct expenses incurred to generate revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue will consist consists primarily of fees associated with the operation of our social media venues and fulfillment of specific customer advertising campaigns related to our downloadable apps. In the case of revenue earned by our wholly owned subsidiary, proceeds allocated to our revenue interest are net of associated costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Share-Based Payments, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
Convertible Debt and Beneficial Conversion Features
The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 ""Derivatives and Hedging"" to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 ""Debt with Conversion and Other Options"" for consideration of any beneficial conversion features.
Stock Settled Debt
In certain instances, the Company will issue convertible notes which contain a provision in which the price of the conversion feature is priced at a fixed discount to the trading price of the Company's common shares as traded in the over-the-counter market. In these instances, the Company records a liability, in addition to the principal amount of the convertible note, as stock-settled debt for the fixed value transferred to the convertible note holder from the fixed discount conversion feature. As of January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, $248,432 for the value of the stock settled debt for certain convertible notes is included in the Convertible note, net account under balance sheet. (see Note 10).
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
The Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and the board of directors of Eco Science Solutions, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eco Science Solutions, Inc. as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
Organization and nature of business
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 8, 2009 under the name Pristine Solutions, Inc. On January 8, 2014, the Company changed its name from Pristine Solutions, Inc. to Eco Science Solutions, Inc.
During fiscal 2016 the Company changed its business focus to pursue eco-friendly consumer related technologies, software and applications.
On January 11, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") authorized the creation of 1,000 shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock. The holder of the shares of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock has the right to vote those shares of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock regarding any matter or action that is required to be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval. The vote of each share of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock is equal to and counted as 10 times the votes of all of the shares of the Company's (i) common stock, and (ii) other voting preferred stock issued and outstanding on the date of each and every vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company regarding each and every matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval.
On June 21, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of capital stock of Ga-Du Corporation (“Ga-Du”), at which time Ga-Du became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Concurrent with the transaction, Mr. John Lewis and Mr. Randall Overton joined the Board of directors of ESSI. Ga-Du offers a Financial Services Platform, as well as Inventory Control and Advisory Software Platforms, and Retail Inventory Control, bringing important enterprise technologies in-house and bringing ESSI an opportunity to expand the reach of its Herbo branding. Subsequently Ga-Du Corporation entered into an Assignment Agreement with G&L Enterprises, wherein G&L Enterprises assigned to Ga-Du Corporation, all of its rights, interest in, and obligations under a License and Master Marketing Agreement (LMMA) it entered into with Alliance Financial Network, Inc. (""AFN"").
AFN provides financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals, including the cannabis industry, on a programmatic or membership basis from which AFN derives fees and income from enrolling companies in their financial program and providing a range of services, with respect to which AFN and Ga-Du derive fees and income on a fee based schedule.
The primary focus of AFN is a mobile application known as eXPO™ electronic eXchange Portal which provides virtual financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals that are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and/or require more intensive compliance than banks are willing, or able to perform and/or do not have the technical expertise or financial wherewithal in house to develop their own FinTech solutions, including accounting and enterprise management software.
Following the closing of the SPA, Ga-Du is a wholly owned subsidiary of ESSI, bringing to ESSI a Financial Services Platform, and Inventory Control and Advisory Software Platforms, thus completing the ESSI product suite to benefit both consumer and professional customers of the Company.
With the acquisition of Ga-Du, ESSI's product suite expanded to include an enclosed ecosystem for business location, localized communications between consumers and business operators, on-topic social networking, inventory management / selection, payment facilitation and delivery arrangement. The Company's holistic commerce and content platform enables health, wellness and alternative medicine enthusiasts to easily locate, access, and connect with others to facilitate the research of and purchasing of eco-science friendly products.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS (cont'd)
Organization and nature of business (cont'd)
During fiscal 2018 and 2019, as AFN focussed its efforts to expand its eXPOTM banking relationships to support next phase operations, the Company focussed on rolling out its Herbo Enterprise Software and building that user base. The Herbo software provides a point of sale, bookkeeping and banking functions, inventory management and tracking, compliance and reporting, tax and accounting, payroll and HR, ecommerce and payment gateway services and CRM and customer loyalty functions all under one software suite. During fiscal 2020, the Company entered into various licensing contracts for the Herbo Enterprise Software and has commenced generating revenue from this segment of its operations.
Eco Science Solutions, Inc. is committed to becoming a vertically integrated provider of consumer and enterprise technology products and services, which assist consumers, companies, brands and entrepreneurs to effectively transact business, with compliance, in the combined multi-billion-dollar cannabis and CBD hemp industries.
The Company's consumer initiatives are centered on education and connecting consumers with various cannabis and CBD hemp businesses. Its enterprise initiatives are focused on developing technology and accounting solutions, coupled with data analytics to help businesses to be more effective in their abilities to connect, market, and sell to consumers.
Eco Science Solutions, Inc has technology and service relationships with those in farming, extraction, manufacturing and distribution in both the cannabis and CBD hemp industries. Along with its subsidiary Ga-Du, ESSI is able to provide a 360-degree ecosystem for business location, localized communications between consumers and business operators, on-topic social networking, inventory management / selection, payment facilitation and cash management.
* Eco Science Solutions, Inc. is not in the business of growing, manufacturing, or distributing cannabis.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As at January 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $11,247,723 and an accumulated deficit of $73,048,082. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on the Company going forward. COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may severely impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and to pursue certain planned business activities. The Company may be required to cease operations if it is unable to finance its’ operations. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report and is highly uncertain and subject to change. Management is actively monitoring the situation but given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to meet its obligations, raise funds or continue to implement its planned business objectives to obtain profitable operations.
The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the Company's consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles, generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period's consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period's presentation.
Principals of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eco Science Solutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ga-Du
Corporation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont'd)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Cash and cash equivalents

Further the Company incurs other advertising expense in respect to its attendance at various venues to promote our business objectives.
Revenue Recognition

Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Mr. Menos amended the Nevada Federal Complaint on December 21, 2018. The Company is identified as a nominal defendant, against which no claims are plead.

(4) On February 1, 2019, the lead plaintiff, Mr. Richard Raschke, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed an amended consolidated class action complaint against the Company, the Taylors, and Mr. Gannon Giguiere in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the ""Class Action""). The Class Action arises out of alleged materially false and misleading statements or omissions from SEC filings and/or public statements by or on behalf of Company. The Class Action asserts claims against all defendants for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Act""), violation of Section 20(a) of the Act against the Taylors and Giguiere and Violation of Section 20(b) against Mr. Giguiere. The Class Action seeks (1) certification of the purported class of plaintiffs, (2) compensatory damages in favor of the class and (3) an award of reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants have moved to stay this action. By consent of the parties, the Court has agreed to suspend this matter pending resolution of the consolidated derivative action in Hawaii.
(5) Although the following lawsuit was not filed against the Company or any of its officers or directors, it nonetheless has a huge impact on the Company. On July 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") filed a Complaint against Gannon Giguiere (""Giguiere""), president of Phenix Ventures, LLC and the Company's largest outside funder. The Complaint alleges Mr. Giguiere's involvement in certain activities, of which the Company, its' officers, board members, and others directly involved with the Company, have no knowledge of. The Complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief. On October 24, 2018, the Court granted the U.S. Government's motion to intervene in the proceedings and stay the action pending resolution of parallel criminal proceedings (described below). Pursuant to the Complaint being filed, the Company continues to seek funding elsewhere as it requires outside funding until it generates more consistent revenue. The Company previously filed an S-1 Registration Statement whereby Phenix would fund the Company in exchange for shares of common stock, and upon Put Notices; to date, there have been no Put Notices and no funds from Phenix Ventures have been distributed to the Company under the registration statement - no shares have been issued pursuant to the Registration Statement.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, under supervision and with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2020, because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting (""ICFR"") described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 14d-14(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting reliability and financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020. In making the assessment, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of January 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that material weaknesses in ICFR existed as more fully described below.
As defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, ""An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements"" established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (""PCAOB""), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of January 31, 2020:
1) Lack of an independent audit committee or audit committee financial expert, and no independent directors. We do not have any members of the Board who are independent directors and we do not have an audit committee. These factors may be counter to corporate governance practices as defined by the various stock exchanges and may lead to less supervision over management;
2) Insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements;
Management's Remediation Initiatives
As of January 31, 2020, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, it was concluded that during the period covered by this report, the internal controls and procedures were not effective due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, management believes these weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. During the course of our evaluation, we did not discover any fraud involving management or any other personnel who play a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting.
Due to a lack of financial and personnel resources, we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until, if ever, we acquire sufficient financing and staff to do so. We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working capital permits. Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended January 31, 2020, fairly presents our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods covered, as identified, in all material respects.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and intrinsic to our small size. Management also believes that these weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the period covered by this report, there were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(7) On September 10, 2018 the Company received a Letter of Summons and Notice of Complaint from Wendy Maguire, Vice President of Business Development for Ga Du Corporation, filed in the United States District Court from the Western District of Washington on September 4, 2018 and naming the Company, its subsidiary Ga Du Corporation and two of the Company's officers as Defendants. The Claims filed under the Complaint include payment of accrued and unpaid wages, legal fees and damages. The Company has filed its Answer. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on March 14, 2019 on her statutory claim for unpaid wages and on her claim for breach of employment contract. The motion has been fully briefed.

The Company is vigorously defending all of the aforementioned lawsuits where the action has yet to be adjudicated, dismissed or judgement entered. The successful defense of any of the outstanding lawsuits is undeterminable at this time, as are the extent of any possible damages.
Other than as set out above, the Company knows of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against it, nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which its director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to its interest.
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
The Company does not have an audit committee. We are not a ""listed company"" under SEC rules and are therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors.
We do not currently have a ""financial expert"" within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the SEC.
The Company has no nominating or compensation committees at this time. The entire Board participates in the nomination and audit oversight processes and considers executive and director compensation. Given the size of the Company and its stage of development, the entire Board is involved in such decision-making processes. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.
Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics within the meaning of Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Code of Ethics applies to directors and senior officers, such as the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller, and persons performing similar functions.

Strategy
The Company is the proprietary owner of emission control technologies with three distinct applications:
●ENVI-MarineTM, for the marine industry;
●ENVI-PureTM, for the waste to energy and biomass industries; and
●ENVI-CleanTM, designed for coal fired power electricity generation and industrial plants involved in steel generation.
The first of the Company’s technologies to gain significant traction has been ENVI-MarineTM. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company secured an order book for its ENVI-MarineTM technology of approximately $180,000,000. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company has added approximately $67,000,000 additional sale agreements.
The Company has been proactively seeking the acquisition and development of other technologies designed to improve the environment. On December 20, 2019, the Company closed the acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd. (Engin) a solar design, development and engineering company and its subsidiary. Engin is a design and engineering business focused primarily on Concentrated Solar Power (“CSP”), desalination and waste to energy technologies. Engin has a number of reference plants in China. The purpose of the acquisition is to build a portfolio of technologies designed to improve the environment.
ENVI-MarineTM
Our marine division has been driving the Company’s rapid growth, with recruiting at all levels and departments to deliver its significant order book to clients and continues to work closely and strengthen ties with its partner PowerChina SPEM.
The Company has been actively marketing its ENVI-Marine™ units to ship brokers and ship owners. During the course of the last 12 months, the Company has recruited a new sales and marketing team based in Oslo, Norway. The new team has initiated a standardized and analytical process to target new customers in the marine sector.
In terms of orders and contracts during the year:
●on July 5, 2019, the Company announced the exercise of an option granted to two customers for an additional 25 ENVI marine units on designated vessels for delivery in 2020;
●on July 11, 2019, Scorpio Tankers Inc. ordered a further 14 ENVI-Marine™ systems for vessels it owns or manages for delivery in 2020, at a combined cost of $20.3 million; and
●on July 11, 2019, Scorpio Bulkers Inc. ordered a further 9 ENVI-Marine™ systems for vessels it owns or manages for delivery in 2020, at a combined cost of $13.0 million.
ENVI-PureTM
Increasing legislation relating to landfill of municipal solid waste has led to the emergence of increasing numbers of waste to energy plants (“WtE”). A WtE plant obviates the need for landfill, burning municipal waste for conversion to electricity. A WtE plant is typically 45-100MW. The ENVI-Pure™ system is particularly suited to WtE as it cleans multiple pollutants in a single system. The Company has successfully tested its ENVI-Pure™ technology at a WtE plant in Edmonton, England, United Kingdom, and is in discussions regarding the installation of its technologies at WtE facilities in China.
ENVI-CleanTM
EnviroTechnologies Inc. has previously conducted successful sulphur dioxide demonstration tests at the American Bituminous Coal Partners power plant in Grant Town, West Virginia.
The testing achieved a three-test average of 99.3% removal efficiency. The implementation of US Clean Air regulations in July 2010 has created additional demand for sulphur dioxide removal in all industries emitting sulphur pollution. Furthermore, China consumes approximately one half of the world’s coal, but introduced measures designed to reduce energy and carbon intensity in its 12th Five Year Plan. Applications include regional power facilities and heating for commercial buildings and greenhouses. Typical applications range in size from 1 to 20 megawatts (MW) with power generation occupying the larger end of the range.
In 2017, Following the signing of a joint venture agreement with PowerChina SPEM, an ENVI-Clean™ was sold to a steelworks company in Yancheng to remove SO2 from its 93MW gas combustion powerplant.
The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels.
Significant transactions
On January 24, 2019, the Company appointed Iain Lees as Chief Operating Officer of the Company.
On May 24, 2019, the Company appointed Richard Oliver as Chief Financial Officer.
On July 2, 2019, the Company announced the resignation of Iain Lees as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer and a Director.

On December 20, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Engin, a development, design and engineering company focused primarily on Concentrated Solar Power (“CSP”), Salt Water Desalination and Waste to Energy technologies. Consideration for the acquisition of 100% of Engin was determined to be a maximum of $11,154,011 (¥78,000,000) and 125,000 shares of common stock. Engin has developed, designed, and engineered three utility scale CSP operating reference plants in China and has a Desalination reference plant in Indonesia:
 
● Dunhuang 100MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Plant;
● CGN Delingha 50MW Parabolic Trough CSP Plant; and
● Dunhuang 10MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Plant.
 
The Company is excited to expand on its portfolio of environmental technologies for future growth and regards CSP as a market for substantial growth. In 2008 CSP accounted for just 0.5GW of world electricity generation rising to 5.5GW in 2018. With the acquisition of Engin and its subsidiary, the Company and vendor have also agreed to form an International Strategic Alliance Agreement between us, the vendor and PowerChina for the development of CSP plants whereby we and Engin provide the intellectual property (the technical know-how, design and engineering), Shouhang provides manufacturing of the solar field and molten salt tank services and PowerChina provides the EPC role both in China and international markets.
On January 20, 2020, Richard Fraser-Smith was appointed the Company’s new Chief Financial Officer.
On February 1, 2020, Dr. Andrew Jolly resigned as Director of the Company. Dr. Jolly’s resignation did not result from any disagreement with the Company regarding its policies, practices or otherwise. Dr. Jolly did not receive any compensation for loss of office. Dr. Jolly will become a Senior Technical Adviser to our Company.
On February 1, 2020, Eric Prouty became an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company.
Form of any subsequent acquisitions
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity, and our relative negotiating strength compared to that of such promoters.
It is likely that we will acquire further participations in business opportunities through the issuance of our common stock, or other of our securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.
Our stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of our voting securities following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by our stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.
Competition
We face competition from various companies involved in the environmental technology industries and specifically companies involved in filtering of pollutants.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry, we will need to:
● establish our product’s competitive advantage with customers;
● develop a comprehensive marketing system; and
● increase our financial resources.
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
As we grow into our chosen strategic field of environmental technologies, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as lack of available funds. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
Intellectual Property
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any registered patent or trademark, except for the following proprietary emission abatement systems and associated marks, currently known as:
●ENVI-Clean™;
●ENVI-Pure™, for removing acid gases, particulate matter, dioxins, VOCs and other regulated hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels; and
●ENVI-Marine™, a scrubber that can be applied to diesel exhaust emissions that require sulphur and particulate matter abatement, (ENVI-Clean™, ENVI-Pure™ and ENVI-Marine™ together, the “Technologies”).
The ENVI-Clean™ system has protected intellectual property rights throughout most of the world. Its technology is protected by Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application no. PCT/CA210/000988 filed June 25, 2010 with a priority filing date of June 25, 2009. The International Preliminary Report on Patentability for this PCT application considered all patent claims of the application to be patentable. EnviroTechnologies has pending national or regional phase patent applications claiming priority from PCT/CA2010/000988 covering 127 countries. Once patents issue, patent rights in this technology will generally endure until June 25, 2030.
Further, we own the rights to the US provisional patent application no. US 61/614696 for the integrated wet scrubbing system. Additionally, we own the rights to US provisional patent application no. US 61/645874 for the flooded wet scrubbing head patent.
We claim copyright in all our published corporate, promotional and sales materials.
Government Regulations
Some aspects of our intended operations will be subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations in North America and worldwide relating to, among other things, worker safety and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. For example, we are subject to the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the principal federal legislation regulating hazardous waste generation, management, and disposal.
Under some of the laws regulating the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Laws of this nature often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the removal or remediation of pollutants and may impose civil and criminal penalties for violations. Some of the laws and regulations authorize the recovery of natural resource damages by the government, injunctive relief and the imposition of stop, control, remediation, and abandonment orders. The costs arising from compliance with environmental and natural resource laws and regulations may increase operating costs for both us and our potential customers. We are also subject to safety policies of jurisdictional-specific Workers Compensation Boards and similar agencies regulating the health and safety of workers.
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our intended business. At this time, we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental or various regulations and requirements.
While our intended projects or business activities have been designed to produce environmentally friendly green energy or other alternative products for which no specific regulatory barriers exist, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs and decreasing potential demand for our technologies, products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Employees
As of March 31, 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries employed people in Canada, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, China, and Norway. The Company also relies heavily upon the use of contractors and consultants. The Company employed approximately 110 staff as of March 31, 2020, but due to a combination of COVID-19 and the drop in the oil price, a number of restructuring activities have taken place since then and further may be considered necessary. On June 19, 2020, the sales office in Oslo, Norway was closed as the Company rethinks its sales strategy.
Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Risks Related to our Business
We have a limited operating history with significant losses.
We have yet to establish any history of profitable operations. We incurred a cumulative deficit of $75,321,335 for the period from April 5, 2011 (inception) to March 31, 2020. We generated our first revenues during the year ended March 31, 2018 of $1,995,000. We generated our first net income during the year ended March 31, 2020 of $10,381,420. We expect that future revenues and profitability will be sufficient to sustain our operations for the foreseeable future. Our profitability will depend on our ability to successfully market and sell the Technologies and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.
We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs due to changes in general economic conditions.
We anticipate needing significant capital to develop our sales force and effectively market the Technologies. We may use capital more rapidly than currently anticipated and incur higher operating expenses than currently expected, and we may be required to depend on external financing to satisfy our operating and capital needs. We may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations or expand our business. Any sustained weakness in the general economic conditions and/or financial markets in the United States or globally could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. We may be unable to secure debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, at the time when we need such funding.
Beginning in 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the volatility of financial markets worldwide. Significant volatility or disruptions of the capital markets could eliminate our access to financing, and/or significantly increase its cost. Such volatility or disruptions in the capital markets may cause lenders to be unwilling to provide us with financing to fund our ongoing operations and growth.
If we do raise funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced, and the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to debt covenants, which could place limitations on our operations including our ability to declare and pay dividends. Our inability to raise additional funds on a timely basis would make it difficult for us to achieve our business objectives and would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, delays and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business in an emerging and evolving industry, including the following factors:
● our business model and strategy are still evolving and are continually being reviewed and revised;
● we may not be able to raise the capital required to develop our initial client base and reputation; and
● we may not be able to successfully develop our planned products and services.
We cannot be sure that we will be successful in meeting these challenges and addressing these risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to do so, our business will not be successful and the value of your investment in us will decline.
Our business is subject to environmental and consumer protection legislation and any changes in such legislation could prevent us from becoming profitable.
The energy production and technology industries are subject to many laws and regulations which govern the protection of the environment, quality control standards, health and safety requirements, and the management, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and other waste. Environmental laws and regulations may require removal or remediation of pollutants and may impose civil and criminal penalties for violations. Some environmental laws and regulations authorize the recovery of natural resource damages by the government, injunctive relief and the imposition of stop, control, remediation, and abandonment orders. Similarly, consumer protection laws impose quality control standards on products marketed to the public and prohibit the distribution and marketing of products not meeting those standards.
The costs arising from compliance with environmental and consumer protection laws and regulations may increase operating costs for both us and our potential customers. Any regulatory changes that impose additional environmental restrictions or quality control requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us through increased operating costs and potential decreased demand for our services, which could prevent us from becoming profitable.
The development and expansion of our business through acquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic transactions may create risks that may reduce the benefits we anticipate from these strategic alliances and may prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability.
We intend to enter into technology acquisition and licensing agreements and strategic alliances such as joint ventures or partnerships in order to develop and commercialize our proposed technologies and services, and to increase our competitiveness. We currently do not have any commitments or agreements regarding acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances. Our management is unable to predict whether or when we will secure any such commitments or agreements, or whether such commitments or agreements will be secured on favorable terms and conditions.
Our ability to continue or expand our operations through acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances depends on many factors, including our ability to identify acquisitions, joint ventures, or partnerships, or access capital markets on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to identify strategic alliance targets, we may be unable to obtain the necessary financing to complete these transactions and could financially overextend ourselves.
Acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing business and difficulties in integrating operations and personnel. Acquisitions or other strategic alliances also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to prior actions involving a predecessor company, or contingent liabilities incurred before a strategic transaction. Due diligence conducted in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. Liabilities associated with an acquisition or a strategic transaction could adversely affect our business and financial performance and reduce the benefits of the acquisition or strategic transaction. Any failure to integrate new businesses or manage any new alliances successfully could adversely affect our business and financial performance and prevent us from achieving profitability.
We are dependent upon our officers for execution of our business plan. As a result, our future success depends heavily upon the continuing services of the members of our senior management team. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Competition for senior management and key personnel is intense, the pool of qualified candidates is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or key personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or key personnel in the future. We do not currently maintain key man insurance on our senior managers. The loss of the services of our senior management team and employees could result in a disruption of operations which could result in reduced revenues.
Outbreaks of epidemic diseases, including COVID-19, could adversely impact our business operations.
Our business could be adversely affected by a widespread second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic which has been predicted by health experts. Many countries have imposed travel bans, quarantines, and other emergency public health measures. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to travel, distribute and install products, as well as force the temporary closure of offices and facilities. In addition, the global marine transportation industry has been negatively affected by travel restrictions and shutdown of businesses. This in turn can reduce demand for our marine scrubbers to these shipping customers if many vessels sit idle or are taken out of service during the outbreak. On June 19, 2020, the Company closed the Norway office as we rethink the sales strategy in the marine division.
The pandemic could also impact our customers and suppliers negatively in operations and financial conditions. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. Further, a pandemic could result in a worldwide health crisis and economic downturn, which could impact our operating results.
Significant drop in oil price may have a material adverse effect on our business.
In March 2020, Saudi Arabia triggered an oil price war in response to Russia’s refusal to reduce oil production in order to keep prices for oil at moderate level. This economic conflict resulted in a sharp drop of oil price over the spring of 2020, including low sulphur fuel oil. The corresponding reduction in the price of low sulphur fuel oil could negatively affect the demand for our marine scrubbers. Fuels with higher sulphur content has been cheaper than low sulphur fuel historically. Our marine scrubbers allow our customers to use fuels with higher sulphur content. A decrease in the demand for marine scrubbers, which allow the use of heavy fuel oil under IMO 2020, could reduce our sales of marine scrubbers.
We are at risk that the Technologies will not perform to expectations.
As at the date of this annual report, the Technologies have been tested to satisfactory requirements but there is no guarantee that the Technologies will continue to perform satisfactorily in the future which would damage our prospects.
The market for alternative energy products, technologies or services is emerging and rapidly evolving and its future success is uncertain. Insufficient demand for the Technologies would prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability.
It is possible that we may spend large sums of money to bring the Technologies to market, but demand may not develop or may develop more slowly than we anticipate.
Our future success is currently dependent on our Technologies and:
(a) our ability to quickly react to technological innovations;
(b) the cost-effectiveness of our Technologies;
(c) the performance and reliability of alternative energy products and services that we develop;
(d) our ability to formalize marketing relationships or secure commitments for our Technologies, products and services; and
(e) realization of sufficient funding to support our marketing and business development plans.
We may be unable to develop widespread commercial markets for our Technologies. We may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.
Competition within the environment sustainability industry may prevent us from becoming profitable.
The alternative energies industry is competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in the market we target as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger competitors’ greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can with our Technologies. A number of competitors have developed more mature businesses than us and have successfully built their names in the international alternative energy markets. These various competitors may be able to offer products, sustainability technologies or services more competitively priced and more widely available than our Technologies and may also have greater resources to create or develop new technologies and products than us. Failure to compete in the alternative energy industry may prevent us from becoming profitable, and thus you may lose your entire investment.
We are at risk that we are unable to manufacture our Technologies in accordance with contractual terms.
All contracts which we secure for the sale of our Technologies will require that we supply a functioning emission control system. There is a risk that we are unable to manufacture and supply our Technologies in accordance with contractual terms. Any failure by us to perform our obligations under any such contract may have a detrimental impact on our financial standing and reputation.
Risks Related to our Stockholders and Shares of Common Stock
The continued sale of our equity securities will dilute the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders and may decrease the market price for our common stock.
As of March 31st, 2020, the Company’s cash reserves are approximately $21.4 million. We expect to continue our efforts to market, manufacture and deliver our Technologies to customers. Should the Company need additional resources, we may consider selling additional equity securities which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. In short, our continued need to sell equity will result in reduced percentage ownership interests for all of our investors, which may decrease the market price for our common stock.
We do not intend to pay dividends and there will thus be fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment.
We have never paid dividends and do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we may require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the declaration of dividends. Because we do not intend to pay dividends, any gain on your investment will need to result from an appreciation in the price of our common stock. There will therefore be fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment. In the future when we do intend to pay dividends, we will formalize a dividend policy.
Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade our securities. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares, which may cause the value of your investment to decline.
Our shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) which imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers-dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a written agreement prior from you to making a sale on your behalf. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that broker-dealers will not want to make a market in our common stock. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your investment to decline.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) sales practice requirements may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.
FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.

Item 7.","Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in section Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this annual report.
Our audited consolidated financial statements are stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Due to the significant growth in operations, sales and personnel, the comparative fiscal period shouldn’t be relied upon to provide an expectation of normal operating levels.
Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020 was $130,138,574 versus $2,074,950 for the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company’s revenues were mainly derived from the sale of marine scrubber units and related services. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the company was in various stages of engineering, delivery, and commissioning of 107 (2019 - 1) marine scrubber units which contributed to revenue of $129,688,156 during the period (2019- $2,074,950). Engin contributed to revenue of $450,418 from providing design and engineering services for CSP contracts during the period from acquisition date of December 20, 2019 until March 31, 2020.
Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 was $51,572,419 and $139,800 respectively. Increases in the Company’s ability to deliver units, meeting customer timelines, and securing shipyards for installations has resulted in significant recognition of revenues and gross profit in the last 12 months.
The gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2020 was approximately 40% (2019- 7%). Management anticipates realizing margins between 20% and 40% in future periods.
Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 were $41,529,313 as compared to $17,045,691 for the year ended March 31, 2019 as the Company continued to grow its management, sales and operations teams in order to deliver on the significant order book.
Consulting fees, technical support, and commissions increased significantly to $22,905,321 from $5,426,136 for the year ended March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2019. Consulting fees, technical support, and commissions were comprised of fees paid to third parties for business development efforts, advisory services, as well as amounts paid to the directors of the Company. Consulting fees paid to third parties for business development and technical support efforts include 20% commission on ENVI-Marine scrubber unit sales to significant clients.
Office and miscellaneous, salaries and wages, and travel and accommodation expenses were recorded at $2,721,884, $6,527,743, and $3,488,165 for the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $268,716, $7,011,859, and $1,031,922 for the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company opened offices in various international locations, hired new employees, and incurred additional travel related costs for the year ended March 31, 2020. Salaries and wages expense decreased due to reduction of $5,759,234 in stock-based compensation during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019.
Advertising and promotion expense for the year ended March 31, 2020 was $1,257,901 versus $590,876 for the year ended March 31, 2019. During the course of the last 12 months, the Company recruited a new sales and marketing team based in Oslo, Norway, though due to a combination of COVID-19 and the drop in the oil price, on June 19, 2020, the sales office in Oslo, Norway was closed as the Company rethinks its sales strategy. There were more promotional events and conferences attended during the last 12 months.
Professional fees increased to $1,428,774 from $844,710 for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to March 31, 2019. Professional fees were mainly comprised of legal, audit, and accounting costs. During the last 12 months, there were more professional fees incurred for contract and acquisition work.
Amortization of intangible assets expense for the year ended March 31, 2020 was $1,070,698 versus $875,813 for the year ended March 31, 2019. Increased amortization cost came from additional intangible assets recorded from Engin acquisition.
The delivery of units resulted in warranty provision being recorded for possible maintenance and claim issues within a prescribed period. For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a warranty provision of $1,630,541 (2019- $922,192) related to the estimated expectation of warranty costs. The Company reserves a warranty provision of 2% (2019- 5%) on the completion of contracts.
Other income of $338,315 was recorded for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to other expenses of $1,032,813 for the year ended March 31, 2019. This change was mainly driven by changes in fair value of derivative liability. The company recorded a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of $257,102 for the year ended March 31, 2020 versus a loss of $356,081 for the year ended March 31, 2019. In addition, the Company recorded $nil for provision for doubtful loan during the year ended March 31, 2020 (2019- $349,858).
Management’s forecasts for operating income of future periods is subject to significant uncertainty as a result of rapid personnel growth and uncertainty in operating costs.
Our financial results for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital Deficit
Cash Flows
As of March 31, 2020, we had $21,386,934 in cash, $64,182,889 in total current assets, $67,713, 871 in total current liabilities, and a working capital deficit of $3,530,982, compared to a working capital deficit of $5,265,387 at March 31, 2019. The Company’s working capital improved as profitable operations provide working capital and operating cash flows to the Company. The Company’s contract assets, contract liabilities and accruals change significantly from period to period, depending on the status of equipment deliveries, customer receipts and payments to third party manufacturers. As at March 31, 2020, we have experienced a significant increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to $43,898,569. The increase is primarily attributable to manufacturing and commissioning costs which have not been invoiced to the Company and accrued additional consideration due for the Engin acquisition estimated at $ 5,190,023.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we received $23,449,250 from operating activities, whereas we spent $2,795,220 on operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2019. Operating cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily consist of deposits and instalments received from customers and our corresponding manufacturing outlays. The Company is in production and manufacturing timeline where we receive large amount of deposits and instalment payments in the last 12 months. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the company was in various stages of engineering, delivery, and commissioning of 107 (2019-1) marine scrubber units which contributed to significant increase in cash flow.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $4,247,690 in investing activities, whereas we used $25,000 in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019. Our investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 were primarily related to the acquisition of Engin and subsidiary and other office equipment.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we spent $614,546 related to financing activities, whereas we received $5,451,500 from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019 which consisted of proceeds from securities purchase agreements. Financing related activities for year ended March 31, 2020 included a payment of $750,000 by the Company to settle a block of stock purchase warrants with a shareholder and the receipt of $135,454 from a director under a share sale profit disgorgement.
Anticipated Cash Requirements
We do not anticipate requiring additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. However, if we do these funds may be raised through asset sales, equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.
Our cash requirement estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.
We currently have office locations in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, China, and Hong Kong. We have hired staff in various regions and rely heavily upon the use of contractors and consultants. Our general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of technical consultants, management, salaries and wages, professional fees, transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and general office expenses. The professional fees have grown significantly and relate to matters such as contract review, business acquisitions, regulatory filings, patent maintenance, and general legal, accounting and auditing fees.
Should we require additional funding over the next twelve months, we would intend to raise new cash requirements from private placements, shareholder loans or possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer). If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time, we do not have a commitment from any broker-dealer to provide us with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.
As of March 31, 2020, we had $21,386,934 cash on hand. Our anticipated profits realized from sales of ENVI marine units are expected to fund our planned expenditure levels. After careful consideration we believe current operations, anticipated deliveries and expected profit from such deliveries to be sufficient to cover expected cash operating expenses over the next 12 months.
Going Concern
Our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets, contract assets and liabilities associated with revenue contracts in progress, contingent consideration on asset acquisition, warranty accruals, fair values of convertible debentures and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from our company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of patents, customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment. The patents, which were acquired in 2013, are being amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 17 years. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company acquired customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, which are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 6, 6, 2, and 10 years.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Our company reviews long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from the sale of emission control equipment and related services as well as providing design and engineering services for Concentrated Solar Power, desalination, and waste to energy technologies.
Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised products or services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following five steps:
●identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
●identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
●determination of the transaction price;
●allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
As our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contracts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin.
Contracts signed with one customer have significant financing component. The Company provides design, production, and installation services of scrubber units to this customer. 20% of the contract price is payable at least 6 calendar months prior to the dry dock date. The remaining 80% is payable in 24 equal monthly instalments starting at the end of the calendar month following the installation date on a vessel by vessel basis. As 80% of the contract price is payable after the last performance obligation towards the scrubber, significant financing component is separated from revenue and interest income at 5.4% is recorded when payments are received from the customer.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Our company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, lease receivable, amounts due from and to related parties, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, operating lease liability, and convertible debenture. The recorded values of all financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
Stock-based compensation
The Company records share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from employees and nonemployees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period. The majority of the Company’s awards vest upon issuance.
Contract Liabilities and Contract Assets
Contractual arrangements with customers for the sale of a scrubber unit generally provide for deposits and instalments through the procurement and design phases of equipment manufacturing. Amounts received from customers, which are not yet recorded as revenues under the Company’s revenue recognition policy are presented as contract liabilities.
Similarly, contractual arrangements with suppliers and manufacturers normally involved with the manufacturing of scrubber units may require advances and deposits at various stages of the manufacturing process. Payments to our manufacturing partners are recorded as contract assets until the equipment is manufactured to specifications and accepted by the customer.
The Company presents the contract liabilities and contract assets on its balance sheet when one of the parties to the revenue contract has performed before the other.
Warranty Provision
The Company reserves a 2% warranty provision on the completion of a contract following the final payment, there being a number of milestone-based stage payments. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and geography of sale. The Company’s product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to twelve to twenty-four months. The Company provides warranties to customers for the design, materials, and installation of scrubber units. The Company has a back-to-back manufacturing guarantee from its major supplier, which covers materials, production, and installation. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures. These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period. Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company’s judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs. The Company intends to assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
Lease
In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases”. This new guidance eliminates the concept of off-balance sheet treatment for “operating leases” for lessees for the vast majority of lease contracts. Under ASU No. 2016-02, at inception, a lessee must classify all leases with a term of over one year as either finance or operating, with both classifications resulting in the recognition of a defined “right-of-use” asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. However, recognition in the income statement will differ depending on the lease classification, with finance leases recognizing the amortization of the right-of-use asset separate from the interest on the lease liability and operating leases recognizing a single total lease expense. ASU No. 2016-02 was in effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the new guidance as of April 1, 2019.
The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients which allows entities not to reassess its previous conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company elected not to use hindsight to determine lease terms and to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component. The Company had no operating leases that were adjusted upon transition as existing leases had duration of 12 months or less at the time of transition. The Company commenced a new operating lease on premises on April 1, 2019 and recognized a right-of-use asset of $1,526,801 and a lease liability of $1,486,605 as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of the new lease standard did not materially impact the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or the consolidated statement of cash flows.

1.Nature of Operations
Pacific Green Technologies Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware, USA on March 10, 1994, under the name of Beta Acquisition Corp. In September 1995, the Company changed its name to In-Sports International, Inc. In August 2002, the Company changed its name to ECash, Inc. On June 13, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Green Technologies Inc. The Company is in the business of acquiring, developing, and marketing environmental technologies, with a focus on emission control technologies.

Engin is a solar design, development, and engineering company (Note 7).
2.Significant Accounting Policies
(a)Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The following accounting policies are consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the following entities:
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
(b)Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets, contract assets and liabilities associated with revenue contracts in progress, contingent consideration on asset acquisition, warranty accruals, fair values of convertible debentures and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
2.Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(c)Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded at the following annual rates, net of any residual value determined.
(d)Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of patents, customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment. The patents, which were acquired in 2013, are being amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 17 years. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company acquired customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, which are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 6, 6, 2, and 10 years.
(e)Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
(f)Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Our company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, lease receivable, amounts due from and to related parties, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, operating lease liability, and convertible debenture. The recorded values of all financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
The following table represents assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value as of March 31, 2020, on a recurring basis:
During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $257,102 (2019 - loss $356,081).
2.Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(g)Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from the sale of emission control equipment and related services as well as providing design and engineering services for Concentrated Solar Power, desalination, and waste to energy technologies.
Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised products or services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following five steps:
●Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
●Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
●Determination of the transaction price
●Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied
The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
As our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contracts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin.
Contracts signed with one customer have significant financing component. The Company provides design, production, and installation services of scrubber units to this customer. 20% of the contract price is payable at least 6 calendar months prior to the dry dock date. The remaining 80% is payable in 24 equal monthly instalments starting at the end of the calendar month following the installation date on a vessel by vessel basis. As 80% of the contract price is payable after the last performance obligation towards the scrubber, significant financing component is separated from revenue and interest income at 5.4% is recorded when payments are received from the customer.
(h)Contract Liabilities and Contract Assets
Contractual arrangements with customers for the sale of a scrubber unit generally provide for deposits and instalments through the procurement and design phases of equipment manufacturing. Amounts received from customers, which are not yet recorded as revenues under the Company’s revenue recognition policy are presented as contract liabilities.
Similarly, contractual arrangements with suppliers and manufacturers normally involved with the manufacturing of scrubber units may require advances and deposits at various stages of the manufacturing process. Payments to our manufacturing partners are recorded as contract assets until the equipment is manufactured to specifications and accepted by the customer.
The Company presents the contract liabilities and contract assets on its balance sheet when one of the parties to the revenue contract has performed before the other.
2.Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(i)Warranty Provision
The Company reserves a 2% warranty provision on the completion of a contract following the final payment, there being a number of milestone-based stage payments. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and geography of sale. The Company’s product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to twelve to twenty-four months. The Company provides warranties to customers for the design, materials, and installation of scrubber units. The Company has a back-to-back manufacturing guarantee from its major supplier, which covers materials, production, and installation. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures. These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period. Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company’s judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs. The Company intends to assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
(j)Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method provides that deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
The Company provides for interest and potential administrative penalties where management has assessed that the probability of assessment is greater than 50%. Interest and penalties assessed or expected to be assessed by tax authorities are included in tax expense for the period.
(k)Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of PGTA, PGTC, PGMT US, PGMTL, PGTrad, PGM Can, and PGN are the United States dollar. The functional currency of ENGIN and GNPE are the Chinese Yuan. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets, liabilities, and items recorded in income arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income.
The accounts of ENGIN and GNPE are translated to United States dollars using the current rate method. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the period-end exchange rate while revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Related exchange gains and losses are included in a separate component of stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
(l)Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged as operating expenses as incurred.
(m)Stock-based compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period. The majority of the Company’s awards vest upon issuance.
2.Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2018-07 - Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, the accounting for employee and non-employee stock options is now aligned.
(n)Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential options and warrants outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible debenture using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at March 31, 2020, the Company had nil (2019 - 7,918,343) anti-dilutive shares outstanding.
(o)Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and items in other comprehensive income (loss) that are excluded from net income or loss. As at March 31, 2020 and 2019, other comprehensive income (loss) includes cumulative translation adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period.
(p)Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases”. This new guidance eliminates the concept of off-balance sheet treatment for “operating leases” for lessees for the vast majority of lease contracts. Under ASU No. 2016-02, at inception, a lessee must classify all leases with a term of over one year as either finance or operating, with both classifications resulting in the recognition of a defined “right-of-use” asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. However, recognition in the income statement will differ depending on the lease classification, with finance leases recognizing the amortization of the right-of-use asset separate from the interest on the lease liability and operating leases recognizing a single total lease expense. ASU No. 2016-02 was in effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the new guidance as of April 1, 2019.
The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients which allows entities not to reassess its previous conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company elected not to use hindsight to determine lease terms and to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component. The Company had no operating leases that were adjusted upon transition as existing leases had duration of 12 months or less at the time of transition. The Company commenced a new operating lease on premises on April 1, 2019 and recognized a right-of-use asset of $1,526,801 and a lease liability of $1,486,605 as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of the new lease standard did not materially impact the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or the consolidated statement of cash flows. For additional disclosure and detail, see note 18 below.
(q)Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. As a smaller reporting company, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
3.Short-term Investments and amounts in escrow
At March 31, 2020, the Company has a $53,106 (CAD $75,000) (March 31, 2019- $38,147 (CAD $50,000) Guaranteed Investment Certificate (“GIC”) held as security against a corporate credit card. The GIC bears interest at 0.5% per annum and matured February 4, 2020.
At March 31, 2020, the Company’s solicitor is holding $664,994 (2019- $1,698,791) relating to proceeds under customer contracts to be released upon satisfying performance obligations.
4.Lease Receivable
On December 12, 2017, the Company completed the sale of a constructed ENVI-Marine scrubber system under an energy management lease arrangement. The Company’s lease receivable as at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, consists of an amount due from the customer under a long-term lease arrangement.
The payments to the Company under the lease arrangement are calculated under a cost savings model. During March 2019, the Company and lessee agreed to a revised payment schedule based on a quarterly payment of $118,000 per quarter through fiscal 2022 in place of the cost saving model. The current portion presented below reflects the minimum expected payments per the lease arrangement for the next twelve months.
At the completion of the minimum required lease payments, the title of the asset transfers to the customer. No amount has been allocated to the residual value. Moreover, there are no other variable amounts involved in this lease arrangement.
5.Property and Equipment
*Acquired as part of a business combination - see Note 7.
The company recorded $87,614 depreciation expense on property and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2020 (2019- $ 9,425).
6.Intangible Assets
*Acquired as part of a business combination - see Note 7
The company recorded $1,070,698 amortization expense on intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2020 (2019- $ 875,813).
7.Acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd
On December 20, 2019, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Engin, a solar design, development and engineering company and its subsidiary. Engin’s expertise in solar technologies provides the Company another green technology to market and develop internationally alongside our manufacturing. The acquisition was concluded concurrently with two groups. The first purchase of the 75% interest was acquired for consideration of $5,864,234 (¥41,000,000) upon signing (paid), plus a further $2,145,002 (¥15,000,000) due by March 20, 2020 (not paid) and a final conditional payment of $2,860,002 (¥20,000,000) by June 30, 2020 (not paid). The remaining 25% interest was acquired for consideration of 125,000 new shares of the Company (issued after year end), plus a further conditional $286,000 (¥2,000,000) payable by June 30, 2020 (not paid). The final payments under both agreements are conditional upon the successful testing of a project, which was to be concluded by June 30, 2020. As at the date of filing, the Company is in process of getting correspondence from the two selling parties regarding the status of the project testing.
7.Acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd (continued)
Total purchase consideration is estimated at $11,052,307, inclusive of the fair value of the conditional payments, which are considered probable. The 125,000 shares in the Company have been estimated to have a fair value of $368,750 or $2.95 per share. This share price is determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company’s common shares at the date of acquisition.
The results of operations of the acquired business and the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements with effect from the date of the acquisition. The purchase consideration has been applied to cash of $2,063,358, other net working capital of Engin of $1,024,461, property and equipment of $911,330, and intangible assets of $3,897,747. The residual value of consideration after applying it to the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired and fair value adjustments, resulted in a goodwill valuation of $3,524,161. The goodwill paid as part of the acquisition is expected to be tax deductible. The measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
Revenue and net income of Engin since the acquisition date included in the consolidated income statement was $450,418 and $92,883, respectively.
The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2018. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of the Company with the stand-alone results of Engin:
8.Sales, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
The Company has analyzed its sales contracts under ASC 606 and has identified performance conditions that are not directly correlated with contractual payment terms with customer. As a result of the timing differences between customer payments and satisfaction of performance conditions, contractual assets and contractual liabilities have been recognized.
Contracts are unique to customers’ requirements. However, the Company’s performance obligations can generally be identified as:
●Specified service works
●Certified design and engineering works
●Acceptance of delivered equipment to customers
●Acceptance of commissioned equipment
8.Sales, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities (continued)
For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company’s recognized sales revenues in proportion to performance obligations as noted below:
Changes in the Company’s contract assets and liabilities for the year are noted as below:
*Payments and accruals under contracts include $12,305,384 presented as receivables which is subject to the fulfilment of future performance obligations.
9.Convertible Debenture and Derivative Liability
On November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a $110,000 convertible debenture with a non-related party, in exchange for $100,000, net of $10,000 for legal fees which was deferred and amortized over the term of the debenture. Under the terms of the debenture, the amount is unsecured, bears guaranteed interest at 10% and default interest at 20% per annum and was due on November 10, 2016. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company equal to the lower of: (a) $0.40 or (b) 60% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the date of conversion.
9.Convertible Debenture and Derivative Liability (continued)
The Company analyzed the conversion option under ASC 815, and determined that the conversion feature should be classified as a liability and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the conversion option. In 2017, the Company issued 470,000 shares of common stock for the conversion of $80,000 of this debenture. As at March 31, 2020, the carrying value of the debenture was $30,000 (2019- $30,000) and interest expense on the debenture for the year was recorded as $6,000 (2019- $6,000).
The fair value of the derivative liability was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. The fair value of the derivative liability is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $257,102 (2019- loss of $356,081). As at March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $174,484 (2019- $431,586).
The following inputs and assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible debenture outstanding as at March 31, 2020, assuming no expected dividends:
A summary of the activity of the derivative liabilities is shown below:
10.Accounts payable and accruals
11.Warranty costs

Product warranty is recorded at the time of sale and will be revised based on new information as system performance data becomes available. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company used 2% to calculate warranty provision (2019- 5%) based on management’s best estimate.
In addition, the Company incurred warranty and related costs of $794,114 during the year ended March 31, 2019 that were a reduction to the lease receivable.

The options had an estimated fair value of $3.62 per share. The estimated fair value of the stock options was being recorded over the requisite service period to vesting. For the year ended March 31, 2020, the fair value of $80,596 was recorded as stock-based compensation. On December 19, 2019, the stock options were forfeited to the Company.
On September 20, 2019, the Company agreed to an extension of 175,000 stock options issued to a director which were due to expire. The stock options have an exercise price of $0.01 per share and have been extended to September 28, 2020. The extension of the stock options has not resulted in any material incremental fair value to be recorded.
The Company agreed to an extension of 312,500 stock options issued to the Company’s former President which were due to expire October 31, 2019. The stock options have an exercise price of $0.01 per share and have been extended to August 31, 2020. The extension of the stock options has not resulted in any material incremental fair value to be recorded.
15.Stock Options (continued)
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
The fair value of stock options vested and recognized during the year ended March 31, 2020 was $91,711 (2019 - $4,993,692), which was recorded as additional paid-in capital and charged to operations. Options granted and unvested at year end due to varied performance conditions, were measured and determined to have an insignificant fair value.
16.Stock-based compensation
The fair value of the Company’s share-based transactions are summarized as follows:
Shares issued to employees or consultants are recorded at their fair value. The fair value for share awards is determined by the quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date approved for issuance by the Board.
17.Segmented Information
The Company is located and operates in North America and its subsidiaries are primarily located and operating in Europe and Asia.
17.Segmented Information (continued)
For the year ended March 31, 2020, 71% (2019-98%) of the Company’s revenues were derived from the largest customer. 11% (2019- 0%) of the Company’s revenues were derived from the second largest customer.
18.Commitments
(a)The Company’s subsidiaries have entered into three long-term operating leases for office premises in London, United Kingdom, Lysaker, Norway and North Vancouver, Canada. These lease assets are categorized as right of use assets under ASU No. 2016-02.
*The Company determined the discount rate with reference to mortgages of similar tenure and terms.
Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As the Company’s operating lease does not provide an implicit rate, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease term. The operating lease asset excludes lease incentives. The operating leases do not contain an option to extend or terminate the lease term at the Company’s discretion, therefore no probable renewal has been added to the expiry date when determining lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
*Including right of use amortization and imputed interest. Lease payments include maintenance, operating expense, and tax.
18.Commitments (continued)
The Company has entered into premises lease agreements with minimum annual lease payments expected over the next five years of the lease as follows:
(b)On July 14, 2017, the Company entered into a new memorandum of understanding to establish a new joint venture company in China with a non-related party (the “Supplier”) wherein the Supplier would receive and process orders, manufacture, and install products for the Company’s customers. In return, the Company agreed to design the product, provide strategic pricing, sales and marketing direction, as well as provide technology licenses and technical support (the “Technology”) to the Supplier. During the term of the agreement, the Company will provide the Supplier with a non-transferrable right and license to use the Technology to manufacture and install the product within the Asia and Russia region.
The parties will fund the venture proportionately, 50.1% by the Company and 49.9% by the Supplier, and excess operating cash flows will be distributed on a quarterly basis. Neither party have funded the joint venture to date and there has been no revenue and expense associated with it.
19.Income Taxes
The majority of our revenues from international sales are invoiced from and collected by our U.S. entity and recognized as a component of income before taxes in the United States as opposed to a foreign jurisdiction. The components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions were as follows:
The following table reconciles the income tax expense (benefit) at the statutory rates to the income tax (benefit) at the Company’s effective tax rate.
19.Income Taxes (continued)
At March 31, 2020, the Company is in arrears on filing a number of its statutory corporate income tax returns for certain entities, primarily, in the United States. The amounts presented above are based on estimates and what management believes are prudent filing positions, where information for fiscal years prior to 2013 has been challenging to obtain. The actual losses available could differ from these estimates upon assessment and review by taxation authorities.
We evaluate tax positions for recognition using a more-likely than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2020 and 2019 are primarily comprised of the following:
On December 22, 2017, the US federal tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including reducing the US federal income corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Under the TCJA, for net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA limits a US corporate taxpayer’s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to 80% of the taxpayer’s taxable income (as modified by the CARES Act, as described below). In addition, NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, with no carryback. NOLs generated in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 are not be subject to the taxable income limitation and generally has a 20 year carryforward. On March 27, 2020 the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). The CARES Act introduced various tax changes, including granting a five-year carry back period for NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, temporary suspension of the 80% taxable income limitation on the use of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 but before January 1, 2021.
The Company estimates that is has accumulated net operating losses of approximately $8.7 million, which were incurred mainly in the U.S., some of which begin to expire in 2036. Historical losses in the U.S., are subject to limitations on use due to deemed changes in control for tax purposes. This impacts the timing and opportunity to use certain losses.
20.Subsequent Event
On July 1, 2020, 3,300,000 share purchase warrants expired unexercised.
Item 9A.",,"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our president (our principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2020. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our president (our principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), our company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020 using the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. On December 20, 2019 PGT acquired 100% of the equity of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd. Please read Item 8 - Financial Statements: Note 7 - Acquisition of Engin. PGT management have excluded from its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as of March 31, 2020, Engin business’s internal control over financial reporting associated with net assets of $7,896,897 and total revenues of $450,418 included in PGT’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, our company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
● We do not have an Audit Committee - While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over our company’s financial statements. Currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
● We did not have adequate accounting personnel throughout the year - The Company has hired a number of qualified financial reporting accountants in Q4 2020. However, it takes time to implement controls over segregation of duties and financial and accounting processes.
As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that our company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no significant change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of our company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Continuing Remediation Efforts to address deficiencies in Company’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting
When the Company has sufficient personnel available, then our board of directors, in particular and in connection with the aforementioned deficiencies, will establish the following remediation measures:
●We will attempt to increase the number of members on our board of directors and nominate an audit committee including a financial expert in the next fiscal year, 2020-2021.
●We will incorporate more controls including segregation of duties and undertake regular and thorough reviews of all accounting entries are in the process of determining how best to implement global controls in relation to these individuals to improve better segregation of duties.

Other Directorships
Other than as disclosed above, our directors and officer do not hold any other directorships in any company with a class of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the Exchange Act or subject to the requirements of section 15(d) of such Act or any company registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Board of Directors and Director Nominees
Since our board of directors does not include a majority of independent directors, the decisions of the board regarding director nominees are made by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. The Board will consider candidates for directors proposed by security holders, although no formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Unless otherwise determined, at any time not less than 90 days prior to the next annual board meeting at which the slate of director nominees is adopted, the board will accept written submissions from proposed nominees that include the name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee; a brief statement of the nominee’s qualifications to serve as a director; and a statement as to why the security holder submitting the proposed nominee believes that the nomination would be in the best interests of our security holders. If the proposed nominee is not the same person as the security holder submitting the name of the nominee, a letter from the nominee agreeing to the submission of his or her name for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a résumé supporting the nominee’s qualifications to serve on the board, as well as a list of references.
The board identifies director nominees through a combination of referrals from different people, including management, existing board members and security holders. Once a candidate has been identified, the board reviews the individual’s experience and background and may discuss the proposed nominee with the source of the recommendation. If the board believes it to be appropriate, board members may meet with the proposed nominee before making a final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of the slate of director nominees submitted to security holders for election to the board.
Some of the factors which the board considers when evaluating proposed nominees include their knowledge of and experience in business matters, finance, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The board may request additional information from each candidate prior to reaching a determination. The board is under no obligation to formally respond to all recommendations, although as a matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so.
Conflicts of Interest
Our directors are not obligated to commit their full time and attention to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating time between our operations and those of other businesses. In the course of their other business activities, they may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. They may also in the future become affiliated with entities, engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In general, officers and directors of a corporation are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
● the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;
● the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and
● it would be unfair to the corporation and its stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the corporation.
We adopted a code of ethics that obligates our directors, officers, and employees to disclose potential conflicts of interest and prohibits those persons from engaging in such transactions without our consent.
Significant Employees
Other than as previously described, we do not expect any other individuals to make a significant contribution to our business.
Legal Proceedings
Except as noted below, to the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:

6. been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.
Note: on or about May 1, 2019 an affiliated shareholder of the Company holding more than ten percent of our issued and outstanding securities, informed the Company that it has profited from the purchase and sale of our stock within a period of less than six months, in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”). Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement dated July 2, 2019, in exchange for the forbearance of legal action by the Company pursuant to Section 16(b), the shareholder has disgorged to our Company the full amount of the profit realized.
Audit Committee
We do not currently have an audit committee or a committee performing similar functions. Our board of directors as a whole participates in the review of financial statements and disclosure.
Family Relationships
There are no family relationships among our officers, directors, or persons nominated for such positions.
Compliance With Section 16(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our shares of common stock and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by our company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners as well as our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners of our subsidiaries were complied with.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors, our company’s officers including our president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, employees, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1. honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;
2. full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us;
3. compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;
4. the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and
5. accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all our company’s senior officers commit to timely, accurate and consistent disclosure of information; that they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity.
In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly senior officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer, who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit 14. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Pacific Green Technologies Inc., Suite #10212 8 The Green, Dover, DE 19901 USA.

As of July 14, 2020, there were 45,659,971 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. All persons named have sole voting and investment control with respect to the shares, except as otherwise noted. The number of shares described below includes shares which the beneficial owner described has the right to acquire within 60 days of the date of this registration statement.
(1) Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares.

Item 13.","Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
Other than set forth below, there have been no other transactions since the beginning of our last fiscal year or any currently proposed transactions in which we are, or plan to be, a participant and the amount involved exceeds $577,928 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we incurred $2,327,560 and $1,196,497 in consultancy fees paid to the officers, directors and companies controlled by them.
As at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, we had amounts due to/from related parties as follows:
(1)
Fresh Air Holdings Pte, Ltd (FAH) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hookipa Trust. FAH provides consulting services pursuant to a consulting agreement dated December 1, 2018. The sole director of FAH is Scott Poulter, a Director of the Company effective May 8, 2017.
Related party transactions occurred in the normal course of operations on terms and conditions that are similar to those of transactions with unrelated parties and, therefore, are measured at the exchange amount.
Director Independence
We currently act with four directors, Dr. Neil Carmichael, Mr. Alex Shead, Mr. Scott Poulter, and Mr. Eric Prouty. Eric Prouty qualifies as “independent director” as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).

We believe that our directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. To the extent that our directors are not capable of effectively performing those tasks, our directors intend to seek appropriate professional guidance. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary, given our early stage of development, to have a standing compensation or nominating committees because we believe that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the board of directors. We will attempt to increase the number of members on our board of directors and nominate an audit committee including a financial expert in the next fiscal year, 2020-2021.
Item 14.","Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services
The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and for fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:
Fees for the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 relate to KPMG LLP.

BUSINESS.
General Overview
McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”).
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4%, 5% and 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Business Model
The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics:
•
The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative.
•
Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership.
•
All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months.
•
We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes.
•
When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life.
The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,061 employees, of whom 94 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 575, 174, 133 and 85 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.
The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s employees. The Company provides training in technical, operational and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development. Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement.
Government Regulations
We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety and other laws and regulations in locations in which we operate. Our activity in jurisdictions in which we operate is additionally subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Our motor vehicles and related units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations. While we incur costs in our business to comply with these laws and regulations, management does not believe that the costs of compliance with these various governmental regulations is material to our business and financial condition.
Available Information
We make the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings available at our website www.mgrc.com. These filings include our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, which are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC.

RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS
Description
Modulars are designed for use as classrooms, temporary offices adjacent to existing facilities, sales offices, construction field offices, restroom buildings, health care clinics, child care facilities, office space, and for a variety of other purposes and may be moved from one location to another. Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities.
Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2020, Mobile Modular purchased 45% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity.
The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future.
Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia, serving large geographic areas in these and surrounding states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. The regional sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 15 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value.
Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership - The Company believes Mobile Modular is the largest supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements.
Expertise - The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications.
Operating Structure - Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs.
Asset Management - The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life
to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases.
Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business.
Market
Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units.
Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application.
Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service.
Rentals
Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular.
The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment.
At December 31, 2020, Mobile Modular owned 56,880 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $882.1 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,508. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 2020, fleet utilization was 76.0% and average fleet utilization during 2020 was 77.2%. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage, which represented approximately 8% of the Company’s 2020 total revenues.
Sales
In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2020 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 13% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 7% of the Company’s consolidated sales and 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.
Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future.
Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions.
Seasonality
Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions.
Competition
Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation (which merged with Mobile Mini in July 2020), have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars.
Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)
Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute:
Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues
Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenue percentage is calculated by dividing Modular rental and sales revenues to public schools (K-12) by the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues.
School Facility Funding
Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms.
ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT
Description
TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located on the grounds of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2020, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 78% general purpose electronic test equipment and 22% communications electronic test equipment.
Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers.
Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers.
TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers.
Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America.
Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams.
Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met.
Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities.
Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides itself
in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business.
Market
Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies.
TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements.
The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints.
Rentals
TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value.
At December 31, 2020, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $333.0 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 67.4% as of December 31, 2020 and averaged 66.2% during the year.
Sales
Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 24% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2020, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 21% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2020, approximately 19% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2020 represented 9% of electronic test equipment sales, 2% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sale of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year.
Seasonality
Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter.
Competition
The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options.

•
roll-off and trash boxes for the temporary storage and transport of solid waste.
Adler Tanks purchases tanks and boxes from various manufacturers located throughout the country.
Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership - The Company believes that Adler Tanks is one of the largest participants in the liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes rental business in North America. Adler Tanks has national reach from branches serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West.
Expertise and Customer Service - The Company believes that Adler Tanks has highly experienced operating management and branch employees. Adler Tanks employees are knowledgeable about the operation of its rental equipment and customer applications. The Company believes that Adler Tanks provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills and the quality of its responsiveness.
Asset Management - The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product. The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value. We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment. The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability and expected equipment returns.
Market
Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services.
The tank and box rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards.
Rentals
Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2020, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $315.7 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 39.8% at December 31, 2020 and averaged 44.6% during the year.
Seasonality
Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve.
Competition
The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals (acquired BakerCorp in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini (merged with WillScot in July 2020), may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION:
Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.
Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to:
•
general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products;
•
legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products;
•
the budgetary constraints of our customers;
•
seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets;
•
success of our strategic growth initiatives;
•
costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses;
•
the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales;
•
the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers;
•
the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors;
•
the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment;
•
our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing;
•
the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets;
•
rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment;
•
movements in interest rates or tax rates;
•
changes in, and application of, accounting rules;
•
changes in the regulations applicable to us; and
•
litigation matters.
As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price.
Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock.
The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to:
•
our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations;
•
any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets;
•
investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC;
•
the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies;
•
any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry;
•
any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock;
•
any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and
•
other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors.
In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price.
The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business.
We continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19.
Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business.
If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel.
Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition.
We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed.
A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business.
We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We could experience theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets
and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties.
Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations.
Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner.
In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with potential failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which, if released, could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers.
Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results.
We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.
Previously, we acquired Technology Rentals & Services (“TRS”), an electronic test equipment rental business and Adler Tanks, a liquid and solid containment rental business, as well as several smaller acquisitions that were integrated into our current operating segments. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;
•
diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business;
•
difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;
•
difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business;
•
timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;
•
an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
•
undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition;
•
negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition;
•
disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale;
•
loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees;
•
an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates;
•
recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;
•
incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and
•
becoming subject to litigation.
Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.
If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.
At December 31, 2020, we had $35.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results.
Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.
The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:
•
the market price for new equipment of a like kind;
•
the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;
•
the supply of used equipment on the market;
•
technological advances relating to the equipment;
•
worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and
•
general economic conditions.
We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected.
The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances.
Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations.
Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence.
The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation.
Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies.
If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results.
Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS:
Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments.
The agreements governing our Series B and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income.
Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $1.2 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $122.8 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected.
GENERAL RISKS:
Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable.
We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. In addition, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities.
Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations.
Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT:
Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability.
Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business.
The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner.
As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.
Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income.
Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income.
Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows.
Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations.
As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations.
Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits.
Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted.
Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results.
In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results.
We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services
and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations.
Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business.
A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business.
We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete.
The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.
Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In August 2018, WillScot Corporation completed the acquisition of Modspace in August, 2018 and Mobile Mini in July, 2020. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business.
We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet.
As of December 31, 2020, 65% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them.
Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability.
We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability.
Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition.
We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2020, Mobile Modular purchased 45% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity.
Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows.
We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows.
Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income.
Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income.
SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT:
Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows.
TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.
Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results.
Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods.
Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge.
Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur
impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers.
Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows.
If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected.
The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results.
If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation.
The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.
If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including:
•
international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers;
•
our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations;
•
greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables;
•
additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations;
•
difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally;
•
language and cultural barriers;
•
seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located;
•
difficulty with the integration of foreign operations;
•
longer payment cycles;
•
currency fluctuations; and
•
potential adverse tax consequences.
Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms.
We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.
SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES BUSINESS SEGMENT:
We may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our rental products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position.
Our rental tanks and boxes are used by our customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids and solids on the customer’s site. Our customers are generally responsible for proper operation of our tank and box rental equipment while on rent and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but exceptions may be granted and we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Although we require the customer to carry commercial general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, such policies often contain pollution exclusions and other exceptions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain our liability insurance will always be sufficient. In addition, if an accident were to occur involving our rental equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when the tank or box was in transport or on rent with our customer, a claim could be made against us as owner of the rental equipment.
In the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including an allegation that an inherent flaw in a tank or box contributed to an accident or that the tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer’s prior use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we take what we believe are reasonable precautions that our rental equipment is in good and safe condition prior to rental and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, such liability could adversely impact our profitability.
The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in rental rates and our ability to rent, or sell, equipment at favorable prices, which could adversely affect our operating results.
The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, including United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, all of which may be larger than we are, may offer a wider range of products and services and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment and lower cost structures than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Some competitors offer different approaches to liquid storage, such as large-volume modular tanks that may have better economics and compete with conventional frac tanks in certain oil and gas field applications. We may in the future encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants. In July 2020, Wilscot acquired Mobile Mini and in July 2018, United Rentals, Inc. completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. Industry consolidation may create additional competition for customers and provide the combined entity access to greater financial resources than we have.
We believe that equipment quality, service levels, rental rates and fleet size are key competitive factors in the liquid and solid containment rental industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing rental rates. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor’s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our operating results through a combination of a decrease in our market share, revenues and operating income.
Market risk, commodity price volatility, regulatory changes or interruptions and cyclical downturns in the industries using tanks and boxes may result in periods of low demand for our products resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows.
Adler Tanks’ revenues are derived from the rental of tanks and boxes to companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and refinement, environmental remediation and wastewater/groundwater treatment, infrastructure and building construction and various industrial services, among others. We expect tank and box rental revenues will primarily be affected by the business activity within these industries. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including the tanks and boxes rented by us. Lower oil or gas prices may have an adverse effect on our liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes business. Any steep decline in both domestic and international oil and gas prices driven by materially higher supply levels and weak demand could have a significant negative impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, especially if such market conditions continue for an extended period of time. If the price reduction causes customers to limit or stop exploration, extraction or refinement activities, resulting in lower demand and pricing for renting Adler Tank’s products, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors may result in excess inventory or impairment charges and reduce our operating results and cash flows.
Changes in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our rental products and reduce our operating results and cash flows.
We believe that demand related to hydraulic fracturing has increased the total rental revenues and market size in recent years. Oil and gas exploration and extraction (including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing to obtain shale oil and shale gas) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, oil and gas exploration and production accounted for approximately 7% of Adler Tanks’ rental revenues, and approximately 1% of the Company’s total revenues. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the Federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt, or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our rental products. Finally, it is possible that changes in the technology utilized in hydraulic fracturing could make it less dependent on liquids and therefore lower the related requirements for the use of our rental products, which would reduce our operating results and cash flows.
Seasonality of the liquid and solid containment rental industry may impact quarterly results.
Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, a company’s project. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of tanks, or boxes, on rent until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods.
Significant increases in raw material, fuel and labor costs could increase our acquisition and operating costs of rental equipment, which would increase operating costs and decrease profitability.
Increases in raw material costs such as steel and labor to manufacture liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes would increase the cost of acquiring new equipment. These price increases could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to recoup these increases through higher rental revenues. In addition, a significant amount of revenues are generated from the transport of rental equipment to and from customers. We own delivery trucks, employ drivers and utilize subcontractors to provide these services. The price of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. During periods of rising fuel and labor costs, and in particular when prices increase rapidly, we may not be able recoup these costs from our customers, which would reduce our profitability.
We derive a meaningful amount of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business from a limited number of customers, the loss of one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Periodically, a meaningful portion of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business may be generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. The loss of any meaningful customer, the failure to collect a material receivable from a meaningful customer, any material reduction in orders by a meaningful customer or the cancellation of a meaningful customer order could significantly reduce our revenues and consequently harm our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations.
We may not be able to quickly redeploy equipment returning from leases at equivalent prices.
Many of our rental transactions are short-term in nature with pricing established on a daily basis. The length of time that a customer needs equipment can often be difficult to determine and can be impacted by a number of factors such as weather, customer funding and project delays. In addition, our equipment is primarily used in the oil and gas, industrial plant services, environmental remediation and infrastructure and building construction industries. Changes in the economic conditions facing any of those industries could result in a significant number of units returning off rent, both for us and our competitors.
If the supply of rental equipment available on the market significantly increases due to units coming off rent, demand for and pricing of our rental products could be adversely impacted. We may experience delays in remarketing our off-rent units to new customers and incur cost to move the units to other regions where demand is stronger. Actions in these circumstances by our competitors may also depress the market price for rental units. These delays and price pressures would adversely affect equipment utilization levels and total revenues, which would reduce our profitability.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Results of Operations
General
The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2020, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 62%, 26%, 6% and 6%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 54%, 27%, 11% and 8%, respectively, for 2019.
The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value.
The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 78% and 79% of the Company’s total revenues in 2020 and for the three years ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 55%, 24% and 21%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs).
The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 22% and 21% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2020 and for the three years ended December 31, 2020. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 76%, 23% and 1% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work.
The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 23%, 25% and 24% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business - Relocatable Modular Buildings - Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.)
Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.
Recent Developments
Dividends
In February 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.435 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, an increase of 4% over the prior year’s comparable quarter.
Credit Facility and Note Purchase Agreement
In March 2020, the Company renewed its $420 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s existing $420 million line of credit. B of A Securities, Inc. served as Sole Bookrunner and Joint Lead Arranger. Bank of America, N.A. served as Administrative Agent, U.S. Bank National Association served as Joint Lead Arranger and Syndication Agent, and MUFG Union Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. served as Syndication Agents.
In March 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million note purchase and private shelf agreement with Prudential Private Capital (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). In addition to governing the terms of the current $40 million Series B Senior Notes and $60 million Series C Senior Notes outstanding, the Note Purchase Agreement allows for the issuance of up to an additional $150 million of senior notes on terms to be determined at such time that any additional notes are issued.
In October 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.
COVID-19
The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which began in December 2019, has continued to spread globally including to every state in the United States. The Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”) have recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence and business sentiment. Each of the states in which the Company operates, and in some cases the localities as well, have previously issued orders requiring the closure of non-essential business and/or requiring residents to stay at home, however, currently none of the Company’s locations are required to be closed by local or state order. The Company is following guidelines established by the CDC and WHO and orders issued by state and local governments where the Company operates. The Company has taken a number of precautionary health and safety measures to safeguard its employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity to enable each of its operating segments and branch locations to continue providing services to customers identified as essential businesses under the relevant state and local rules. The Company has implemented remote work policies, restricted travel, separated work groups, enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities, products and vehicles, and requires distancing protocols for production and logistical personnel. The Company is continuing to monitor and assessing orders issued by federal, state and local governments to ensure compliance with evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The Company also continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its existing customers who themselves may be impacted by governmental shutdowns and other impacts due to the governmental orders.
As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken a number of precautionary measures to manage its resources conservatively by reducing and/or deferring non-essential capital expenditures and operating expenses to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The Company will continue to assess its capital expenditure needs against its cash availability during the crisis to make the most strategic decisions for its business. Furthermore, the Company believes that its recently renewed $420 million credit facility, coupled with its ability to access additional capital through the issuance of up to $150 million in additional senior notes, will strengthen the Company’s liquidity position and serve to mitigate some of the operational risk related to decreased customer demand for new rental orders and sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the Company has not seen a significant impact from COVID-19 in the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 as set forth in the below section discussing the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is currently unable to determine or predict the full nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of employees, customers and shareholders.

Enviroplex’s gross profit decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, due to $7.1 million lower sales revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit decreased $12.9 million, or 28%, due to lower gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues.
•
Selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million, or 1%, to $123.0 million, primarily due to decreased travel, meals and meeting expenses.
•
Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 29%, due to 21% lower net average interest rate of 3.25% in 2020 compared to 4.10% in 2019 and 10% lower average debt levels of the Company.
•
Pre-tax income contribution was 62%, 26% and 6% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2019, compared to 54%, 27% and 11%, respectively, in 2019. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 6% and 8% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.8% and 25.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•
Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.2 million, or 2%, to $241.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.” on page 30.
Mobile Modular
For 2020, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $20.5 million, or 7%, to $321.5 million compared to 2019, primarily due to higher sales and rental revenues, partly offset by lower rental related services. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $12.3 million, or 18%, to $82.3 million in 2020.
The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

Mobile Modular’s gross profit for 2020 increased $12.3 million, or 9%, to $155.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $6.4 million, or 4%, due to 1% higher average rental equipment on rent and 2% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2020 and 2019 and other direct costs were 25% in 2020 and 28% in 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 63% in 2020 compared to 60% and 2019. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $8.9 million, or 8%, to $118.0 million in 2020.
•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2019. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The decrease in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to lower amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and lower repair revenues, partly offset by increased site related services revenues. The lower revenues offset by higher gross margin percentage of 28% in 2020 compared to 25% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.0 million, or 6%, to $18.6 million in 2020.
•
Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $16.8 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margins of 28% in 2020 compared to 31% in 2019, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.2 million, or 22%, to $17.9 million in 2020. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.
For 2020, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 4%, to $68.5 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses and increased salaries and benefit costs, partly offset by lower travel, meals and meeting costs.
TRS-RenTelco
For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $9.3 million, or 7%, to $140.8 million compared to 2019, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for 2020, primarily due to higher gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses.
The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit for 2020 increased $0.1 million to $60.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $5.4 million, or 5%, to $109.1 million with depreciation expense increasing $4.5 million, or 11%, and other direct costs increasing $0.8 million, or 5%, resulting in a comparable gross profit on rental revenues of $45.5 million in 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 43% in 2020 and 40% in 2019 and other direct costs was 16% in 2020 and 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 42% in 2020 compared to 44% in 2019. The rental revenues increase was due to 10% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 4% lower average monthly rental rates.
•
Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $4.5 million, or 20%, to $26.6 million in 2020. Gross profit on sales increased $0.3 million with gross margin percentage decreasing to 48% from 56% in 2019, primarily due to lower gross margins on used equipment sales. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.
For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $24.3 million, primarily due to lower salaries and benefit costs and lower travel, meals and meeting expenses, partly offset by higher allocated corporate expenses.

Adler Tanks’ gross profit for 2020 decreased $12.9 million, or 28%, to $34.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues decreased $13.9 million, or 20%, to $54.0 million, due to 18% lower average rental equipment on rent and 2% lower average monthly rental rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. The rental revenue decrease was primarily due to COVID-19 related business disruptions and a decrease in the price of oil and gas, which contributed to weaker activities in multiple geographic and market segments. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 30% and 24% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and other direct costs were 17% and 18% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 53% in 2020 compared to 58% in 2019. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $10.9 million, or 28%, to $28.6 million in 2020.
•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 23%, compared to 2019. The lower revenues together with lower gross margin percentage of 23% in 2020 compared to 24% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $1.7 million, or 25%, to $5.0 million in 2020.
For 2020, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses decreased $4.6 million, or 16%, to $24.8 million, primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefit costs, travel, meals and meeting expenses and lower corporate allocated expenses.

Pre-tax income contribution was 54%, 27% and 11% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2019, compared to 53%, 28% and 14%, respectively, in 2018. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 8% and 5% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0% and 24.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•
Adjusted EBITDA increased $33.7 million, or 17%, to $236.8 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.” on page 30.
Mobile Modular
For 2019, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $46.4 million, or 18%, to $301.0 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rental, rental related services and sales revenues. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $14.4 million, or 26%, to $70.0 million in 2019.
The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

Mobile Modular’s gross profit for 2019 increased $22.9 million, or 19%, to $143.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $23.2 million, or 15%, due to 6% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2019 compared to 13% in 2018 and other direct costs were 28% in 2019 and 27% in 2018, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2019 and 2018. The higher rental revenues and comparable rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $14.0 million, or 15%, to $109.1 million in 2019.
•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $14.7 million, or 27%, compared to 2018. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 25% in 2019 compared to 24% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $4.6 million, or 35%, to $17.6 million in 2019.
•
Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $7.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, together with higher gross margins of 31% in 2019 compared to 29% in 2018, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.3 million, or 29%, to $14.6 million in 2019. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.
For 2019, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $7.7 million, or 13%, to $65.7 million, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.
TRS-RenTelco
For 2019, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $12.8 million, or 11%, to $131.5 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $5.5 million, or 19%, to $34.2 million for 2019, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.
The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit for 2019 increased $6.0 million, or 11%, to $60.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $13.8 million, or 15%, to $103.7 million with depreciation expense increasing $5.9 million, or 16%, and other direct costs increasing $1.6 million, or 11%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $6.2 million, or 16%, to $45.5 million in 2019. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2019 and 2018 and other direct costs was 16% in 2019 and 2018, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2019 and 2018. The rental revenues increase was due to 17% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average monthly rental rates.
•
Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues decreased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $22.1 million in 2019. Gross profit on sales decreased $0.2 million with gross margin percentage increasing to 56% from 55% in 2018, primarily due to higher gross margins on used equipment sales. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.
For 2019, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8%, to $24.6 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.
Adler Tanks
For 2019, Adler Tanks’ total revenues increased $1.9 million, or 2%, to $97.9 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rental related services and sales revenues, partly offset by lower rental revenues.

•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, to $67.9 million, due to 8% lower average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 5% higher average monthly rental rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 24% and 23% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and other direct costs were 18% and 16% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 58% in 2019 compared to 61% in 2018. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $3.0 million, or 7%, to $39.6 million in 2019.
•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $3.5 million, or 14%, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased cleaning and repair revenues. The higher revenues together with higher gross margin percentage of 24% in 2019 compared to 20% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.7 million, or 34%, to $6.7 million in 2019.
For 2019, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 2%, to $29.3 million, primarily due to decreased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2020 as compared to 2019 are summarized as follows:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $180.5 million for 2020 as compared to $188.0 million in 2019. The 4% decrease was primarily attributable to decreased deferred income and deferred income taxes, a lower decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other balance sheet changes.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $53.0 million for 2020 as compared to $143.1 million in 2019. The $90.1 million decrease was primarily due to $81.4 million lower purchases of rental equipment of $86.3 million in 2020, compared to 2019, and $7.8 million lower cash paid for acquisition of business assets, partly offset by $1.6 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment and $2.6 million higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $128.5 million in 2020 as compared to $44.0 million in 2019. The $84.4 million increase was primarily due to $65.5 million higher net repayment under bank lines of credit, $13.6 million higher repurchases of common stock and $4.3 million higher dividend payments.
Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock.
As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.
Funding of Rental Asset Growth
In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $13.7 million in 2020, $12.1 million in 2019 and $15.7 million in 2018, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $39.8 million, $35.5 million and $30.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.
Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and due March 17, 2021, and (ii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020.
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016.
At December 31, 2020, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $122.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1.
At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants.
Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement
In March 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes due March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply.
In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note.
On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.
3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021
In March 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million.
3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022
In November 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.
Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1.
At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants.
Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Furthermore, the Company believes it has the financial resources to weather the expected impacts of COVID-19. However, the Company has limited insight into the extent to which its business may be impacted by COVID-19, and there are many uncertainties, including how long and how severely the Company will be impacted. An extended and severe impact may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future operations, financial position and liquidity.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2025, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2020 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.
Payments Due by Period
The Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2021 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings.
Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 65 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash.
Critical Accounting Policies
In response to the SEC’s Release No. 33-8040, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,” the Company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Revenue recognition:
Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.
Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.
Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness.
The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies.
Changes in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant.
Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company’s financial results.
Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit’s carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount equal to the difference the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
Impact of Inflation
Although the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future.
Off Balance Sheet Transactions
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any “off-balance-sheet arrangements,” as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2020. The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company’s Series B and Series C Senior Notes and the Company’s revolving lines of credit under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility as of December 31, 2020.
The Company formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., in 2004 in conjunction with the TRS acquisition and a wholly owned Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited, in 2013. The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the
financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2020, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant.
The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements.
The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.
The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Board of Directors and Shareholders
McGrath RentCorp
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Board of Directors and Shareholders
McGrath RentCorp
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment
As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We identified the valuation of the Company’s TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter.
The principal consideration for our determination of the valuation of the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter is that the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment can be sensitive to new developments in technology, which creates the risk that equipment could become obsolete or impaired. Management’s impairment analysis relies on estimates of future financial performance of its rental equipment. These estimates include assumptions based upon historical and projected results including utilization, rental pricing and the equipment’s useful life and expected sales proceeds. The failure to achieve these projections might be indicators of potential impairment.
Our audit procedures related to the impairment of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment included the following, among others.
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment process, determination of the assumptions, and review of equipment that didn’t meet assumed performance thresholds.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to the rental equipment.
•
We analyzed trends in utilization and yield at a disaggregated product level, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to evaluate if indicators of impairment were present for any particular product.
•
For a sample of assets, we inspected underlying documents and compared to the information in management’s analysis for accuracy.
•
We independently identified any underperforming assets by recalculating management’s analysis performed by using actual margins on sales proceeds.
•
For assets discussed above, we inquired of management with respect to the assets and factors driving assessment of realizability and corroborated explanations received.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”).
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.
Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment.
Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services.
Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses.
Depreciation of Rental Equipment
Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows:
Relocatable modular buildings
18 years, 50% residual value
Relocatable modular accessories
3 to 18 years, no residual value
Blast resistant modules
20 years, no residual value
Portable storage containers
25 years, 62.5% residual value
Electronic test equipment and accessories
1 to 8 years, no residual value
Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories
3 to 20 years, no residual value
Costs of Rental Related Services
Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company recorded an impairment of modular rental equipment of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations
Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale.
Warranty Reserves
Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $8.6 million, $8.2 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land, land improvements and information technology upgrades.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized $0.1 million and $3.0 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $3.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets related to customer relationships are amortized over eleven years. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $34.1 million.
The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows
were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results.
The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2020. The impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2020. There were no impairment charges in 2019 or 2018. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:
In 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Company has made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company repurchased 282,221 shares of its common stock for an average purchase price of $48.25 per share or an aggregate price of $13.6 million. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase.
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $38.7 million at December 31, 2020 and $37.2 million at December 31, 2019. The Company sells primarily on 30-day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an
evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $103.1 million and $101.4 million compared to the recorded value of $100.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation
The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur.
The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year.
Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when vesting conditions are met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company recognizes forfeitures based on actual forfeitures when they occur. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “Note 8 -Benefit Plans”.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes. The ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 3. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, intended to simplify the subsequent accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. Prior guidance required utilizing a two-step process to review goodwill for impairment. A second step was required if there was an indication that an impairment may exist, and the second step required calculating the potential impairment by comparing implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's estimated fair value. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) effective January 1, 2020. Under the new guidance, companies are required to present financial assets held at amortized cost and available for sale debt securities net of the amount expected to be collected. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Trade accounts receivable
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company’s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company recognized bad debt expense of $1.3 million, $1.0 million and 0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net investment in sales-type leases
The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its rental equipment, primarily at its TRS-RenTelco operating segment. Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 12 to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying rental asset. The net investment in sales-type leases was $1.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $2.9 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s assessment of current expected losses on these receivables was not material and no credit loss expense was provided as of December 31, 2020. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience, the age of the lease receivable balances, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice. The Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases, on an ongoing basis, using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: historical payment history, credit score, size of operations, length of time in business, industry, historical profitability, historical cash flows, liquidity and past due amounts. The Company uses credit scores obtained from external credit bureaus as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality of its new customers. The Company does not own available for sale debt securities or other financial assets at December 31, 2020.
NOTE 4. LEASES
Lessee
The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate. If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. These leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from one to three years. The amount of payments associated with such options is not material. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases. At December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was $8.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating lease expense was $3.8 million, which includes short term lease expense of $0.1 million. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 3.2 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.95%. The Company had no sub-lease income during the year ended December 31, 2020, and did not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2020.
Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows:
Lessor
The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions. The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement. The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases. These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from one to sixty months. Customers have the option to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs. All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately three to five years. The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
As of December 31, 2020, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2021 and thereafter were as follows:
In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s lease revenues were $401.9 million, consisting of $399.5 of operating lease revenues and $2.4 million of finance lease revenues. The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis, which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $2.2 million of sales revenues and $0.2 million of interest income. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance leases to be received in 2021 and thereafter were as follows:
NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company utilized the modified retrospective method of adoption and there was no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements, nor was there a cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard. The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the
benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.
The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $11.3 million and $17.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $17.0 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $1.4 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Lease Revenues
Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.
Non-Lease Revenues
Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues.
Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue.
Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses.
The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 840) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant.
The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months.
NOTE 6. NOTES PAYABLE
Notes payable consists of the following:
As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum payments under the unsecured revolving lines of credit, 3.68% Series B senior notes due in 2021 and 3.84% Series C senior notes due in 2022 are as follows:
Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and due March 17, 2021, and (ii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020.
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016.
At December 31, 2020, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $122.8 million was outstanding. The Amended Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1.
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either: (i) LIBOR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin. The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0% to 0.75% for base rate loans. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $420.0 million credit facility that is not used. These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 0.15% to 0.30%. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the applicable margins were 1.25% for LIBOR based loans, 0.25% for base rate loans and 0.20% for unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $12.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility. The following information relates to the lines of credit for each of the following periods:
Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes due March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply.
In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note.
On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.
3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021
On March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the purchaser a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Prior NPA. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million.
3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022
On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the purchaser a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Prior NPA. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on November 5, 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior
Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.
Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1.
At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in the Company’s financial performance could impact its ability to comply with these covenants.
NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES
Income before provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:
The following table shows the deferred income taxes related to the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the respective amounts included in “Deferred income taxes, net” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets:
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted in December 2017. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act without any material adjustments to its previous estimates.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have a deferred tax liability related to its foreign earnings because it did not have any specific plans to repatriate funds from its international subsidiaries. The Company may do so in the future if a dividend can be remitted with no material tax impact.
In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023.
For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $1.9 million, $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2016.
Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
NOTE 8. BENEFIT PLANS
Stock Plans
The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan.
The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the share-based compensation expense was $5.5 million, $5.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Stock Options
As of December 31, 2020, a cumulative total of 9,118,500 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $3.47 to $40.37. Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,378,218 shares, while options for 1,670,972 shares have been terminated, and options for 409,410 shares with exercise prices ranging from $24.60 to $40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 2020, 1,548,908 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans.
A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:
The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $11.9 million, $9.1 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $0.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year.
The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2020:
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
No options were granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Restricted Stock Units
The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2020:
Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years, with 60% of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20% of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance-
based RSU grants vest after three years with 100% of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 184,091 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2020. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 93,040 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2020. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 based on the weighted average grant date values was $3.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4.6 million, $4.7 million and $2.6, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $7.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans
The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least three months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2020 dividends deducted by the Company were $0.4 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million in 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the KSOP held 240,187 shares, or 1% of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.
NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows:
Facility rent expense was $3.7 million in 2020, $3.9 million in 2019 and $3.5 million in 2018.
The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company.
The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
NOTE 11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of the following:
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. Amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2020 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $0.2 million in 2021 and $0.2 million in 2022 through 2026.
NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
There were no related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates.
NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING
FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues. Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits. The Company does not report total assets by business segment. Summarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables:
1Gross Enviroplex sales revenues were $34,014, $39,814 and $30,407 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were $1,277 and $1,361 inter-segment sales to Mobile Modular in 2020 and 2018, which have been eliminated in consolidation. There were no inter-segment sales in 2019.
2Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. The average utilization for the period is calculated using the average costs of rental equipment.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4%, 5% and 4% of the Company’s revenues for the same periods, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level.
Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 57.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1678463_2020.htm,1678463,2020,"Item 1. Business
On March 13, 2015, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P. (which is referred to, along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding us and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as Lone Star) acquired the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG, or HC, in the United States and Eastern Canada, or the Acquisition. Unless otherwise specified or where the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “our,” “we,” “us,” the “Company” and “our business” refer to the operations of Forterra, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 2016. We are controlled by Lone Star and have been operating as a stand-alone company since 2015.
Recent Developments
On February 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Quikrete Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Parent, and Jordan Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, or the Merger, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company (other than (i) any shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) shares that are subject to any vesting restrictions (“Company Restricted Shares”) granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans, (iii) any shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $24.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, Overview for a more fulsome description of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and its terms and expected impact on our business.
General
We are a manufacturer of concrete pipe and precast products and ductile iron pipe in the United States and Eastern Canada for a variety of essential water-related infrastructure applications. Our products and services are used in the construction, maintenance, repair and replacement of water drainage, distribution and transmission systems.
Our manufacturing and distribution network allows us to serve most major markets in the United States and Eastern Canada. We operate 77 active manufacturing facilities with capacity that allows us to serve our customers' needs.
We manufacture both water drainage pipe and precast structures (used primarily for storm water and drainage applications) and water transmission and distribution pipe (used primarily to transport potable water and as a component of wastewater systems) and believe our complementary product portfolio is well positioned to serve both (i) the storm water and wastewater infrastructure market and (ii) the potable water transmission and distribution market. We serve a diverse set of end markets, including infrastructure, residential, and non-residential construction, which allows us to benefit from both secular and cyclical growth across each of these end-markets. The infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets in the United States and Eastern Canada have different growth drivers and operating dynamics, and the cyclical performance of these markets has historically been staggered during different stages of the broader economic cycle serving to mitigate the cyclical impact of any one single market on our business. In addition, given the nature of water as a basic necessity, municipalities generally repair and replace their existing water and wastewater infrastructure.
Our operational strategy is focused on our five improvement pillars:
•Health and Safety - Prioritizing the health and safety of our employees above anything else; our most productive facilities should be our safest
•Plant-level Operational Discipline - Making daily improvements using our manufacturing/process know-how to drive efficiencies with disciplined financial investment
•Enhanced Commercial Capabilities-Investing in our sales force to expand capabilities and better inform our customers of our compelling value proposition
•Working Capital Efficiency-Having the right levels of inventory in the right places at the right times and aligning our accounts receivable and accounts payable cycles
•G&A Effectiveness-Delivering deeper information faster and at a lower cost so operators can make better business decisions
Our solid execution on these five pillars has produced, and we believe will continue to produce, the earnings and cash flows to continue to reduce our net leverage ratio to our stated mid-term target of 3.0x to 3.5x earnings. Our organic growth strategy is focused on leveraging our operations, customer service and product innovation capabilities, as well as our product breadth and scale, to sell our products to existing customers, to increase penetration and project wins and to gain market share through new customers. Operationally, we continue to focus on efficiency and productivity improvements to reduce costs and drive unit margin improvements. We periodically evaluate our existing business and acquisition opportunities to complement our organic growth or enhance our scale, geographic footprint and product portfolio while simultaneously considering and making strategic divestitures or changes in our manufacturing footprint to optimize our portfolio. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our recent acquisitions and divestitures.
Our Segments
Drainage Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products by sales volume in the United States and Eastern Canada. In addition, we also produce concrete pressure pipe in Eastern Canada. We operate 62 active manufacturing facilities across multiple states and a Canadian province. These facilities provide us with a local presence and the necessary proximity to our customers to minimize delivery times and distribution costs to the markets we serve. We believe our product offering creates value for our customers as it eliminates the need to engage multiple suppliers of storm water and wastewater-related products for a single project, enabling them to maximize efficiency and meet more aggressive timetables. We also have the ability to custom-build products to complex specifications and regulations.
Drainage pipe has residential, non-residential and infrastructure applications. It is primarily used for storm water applications, such as storm drains for roads and highways, and for residential and non-residential site developments. In addition, drainage pipe is used for sanitary sewers, low-pressure sewer force mains, tunneled systems, treatment plant piping and utility tunnels.
Water Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of ductile iron pipe, or DIP, by sales volume in the United States. Utilizing the U.S. Pipe brand, we manufacture a number of products used for the transmission of potable water and wastewater in pipe diameters typically ranging from three to 64 inches. Our product breadth and depth and our technical service address a range of our customers' water transmission and distribution needs. Our 15 manufacturing facilities are located across the United States, with swing capacity available to support increased production levels as appropriate to satisfy increased demand.

Our Industry and Core End Markets
We serve a range of infrastructure-related end markets. Based on the source of funding, we classify these construction markets into infrastructure/municipal, residential and non-residential.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure represents spending by federal, state, and local governments for the construction and repair of streets, highways, storm and sanitary sewers, as well as the construction and repair of water lines for the delivery of potable water, which are often supported by multi-year federal and state legislation and programs. It also includes local municipalities water infrastructure spending associated with the construction, repair and replacement of water transportation and distribution systems. Spending on these items is driven by federal, state and municipal funding for both new build and repair projects. In addition to availability of funding at the federal, state and municipal levels, these programs are impacted by other factors, including demographic and population shifts and the ability of contractors to obtain skilled labor.
A large proportion of U.S. water infrastructure is approaching, or has already reached, the end of its useful life. According to The American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, many drinking water pipes in the U.S. were laid from 1900 to 1950. Today, aging pipelines contribute to the estimated 240,000 water main breaks per year in the U.S., wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water. Additionally, lead pipes and fixtures, which were commonly installed through the mid-20th century, are still in service in some cities. The American Water Works Association estimated that the need for buried drinking water infrastructure in the U.S. through 2050 totals nearly $1.7 trillion, about 54% of which is needed for replacement of existing infrastructure and the balance being necessary to accommodate population growth and migration over that period. ASCE gave the U.S. wastewater infrastructure a grade of D+ and, in 2017, estimated that 56 million new users would be connected to centralized treatment systems over the next 15 years requiring at least $271 billion to meet current and future demands and to upgrade existing infrastructure. Likewise, the ASCE grades the U.S. surface transportation (roads, bridges, and transit) infrastructure D/C+/D- and has identified over $1 trillion in additional spending needed to repair and upgrade existing structures as well as construction of new facilities to accommodate growth through 2025. As the leader in our respective markets serving the water related infrastructure industry, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this much needed spending to repair and upgrade U.S. infrastructure.
Residential Construction
Residential construction includes single family homes and multi-family units such as apartments and condominiums. In this end market, our products are primarily used during the new lot development phase of construction. New residential housing starts provide a strong leading indicator of increased activity in the residential construction market for water transmission, wastewater and drainage systems. Demand for residential construction is influenced by demographic and population shifts, mortgage interest rates, and the ability of builders to obtain skilled labor. U.S. residential new construction peaked in 2006 before experiencing a downturn from 2007 to 2011. Since 2011, the recovery of residential new construction has translated into increased demand for our products and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize as and to the extent this trend continues. In 2020, total annual housing starts in the United States increased to 1.7 million, an increase of 5.2% above 2019 housing starts according to the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Since 1974, annual additions to the housing supply exceeded household growth by an average of 30% to accommodate replacement of older units, demand for second homes, geographic shifts in the population, and a normal amount of vacancies. However, for most of the last decade, housing production has barely kept pace with household formation. We believe this indicates there is significant pent up demand for housing and that the market will see continued growth. The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University estimates annual construction should now be on the order of 1.5 million units, or about 210,000 higher than in 2019.
Non-residential Construction
Non-residential construction includes all privately financed construction other than residential structures. Revenues in this end-market are driven largely by new United States non-residential construction, for which demand is generally driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. Our products in this end market tend to be utilized primarily in shopping centers and similar types of suburban development as opposed to development of large office buildings, and we believe that the demand for suburban development should be stable to growing over the short to medium term. The supply of non-residential construction projects is also affected by the availability and cost of funding.
Our Products
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
We manufacture drainage pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada. We also manufacture concrete pressure pipe products in Eastern Canada. Drainage pipe has residential, non-residential and infrastructure applications. It is primarily used for storm water applications, such as storm drains for roads and highways, and for residential and non-residential site developments. In addition, drainage pipe is used for sanitary sewers, low-pressure sewer force mains, tunneled systems, treatment plant piping and utility tunnels.
Drainage pipe consists of concrete reinforced by a steel cage. It is manufactured by producing a steel mesh cage, enclosing it in a form or mold and then pouring concrete around it to produce the pipe. Drainage pipe is manufactured in round, elliptical and arch shapes ranging from 12 inches to 144 inches in diameter and in box sizes ranging from three feet to 20 feet in length and width. We also manufacture a wide variety of precast concrete products, including box culverts, utility vaults, manholes, drainage inlets and pipe end sections. These precast concrete products are used for applications such as roadway drainage, airport drainage, storm water management, utility construction and water treatment and filtration systems. Our range of precast concrete products also includes products that fall under the general description of specialty precast, including products for which we hold patents that make us the exclusive manufacturer, or which are manufactured under license agreements with third parties. These specialty products include architectural panels for buildings, modular railroad crossings, retaining wall systems, highway noise barriers, storm water treatment systems and concrete vaults, which are used to house either dry utilities (such as electrical, data or communications equipment) or wet utilities (such as valves, pumps or water meters).
We also manufacture structural precast products in the United States and manufacture a range of precast concrete bridge girders for highway projects in both the United States and Eastern Canada. We manufacture a
variety of structural precast products primarily for infrastructure and non-residential applications, including hollow-core planks, prestressed bridge girders, beams, columns, wall panels, stairs, garage floors and architectural cladding. These products are used as structural and architectural elements in building structures such as parking garages and arched and modular bridges.
Precast concrete products are reinforced with steel, similar to pipe, and manufactured using either a dry cast or wet cast concrete mix, depending on the size of the piece and the number of identical pieces to be manufactured. In the dry cast method, a concrete mix with low water content, known as zero-slump concrete, is poured into a mold and then densely compacted around the steel reinforcement using a variety of manufacturing methods. The concrete structure is immediately removed from the mold and allowed to cure in a high humidity environment to ensure proper hydration of the concrete. This method allows multiple pieces to be produced from the same mold each day and is most suitable for high volume, repetitive manufacturing. In the wet cast method, a concrete mix with relatively high water content is poured into a mold and allowed to cure in the mold, which can take from four to 16 hours. Precast concrete products typically range in diameter from four to 12 feet for round products or in length and width from one foot to 12 feet for square or rectangular products.
We also regularly consider ways to innovate internally and expand our drainage pipe and precast product offerings by working to bring other products to market. Some of our product offerings include precast Duct Bank, Kenner Chainwall, and a number of storm water innovative technologies for storm water management marketed through our Bio Clean subsidiary. Kenner Chainwall is a precast concrete foundation that provides a structurally sound, on-grade or elevated foundation to support prefabricated shelters or equipment buildings. One use is to elevate electrical equipment in flood zones such as those devastated by hurricanes. Duct Bank is a precast product that consolidates and protects underground electrical and communication cables and can be used in the construction of large buildings as well as installing cabling underneath roads and areas with existing structures. Each of these products is now commercially available.
In addition, for larger diameter applications, we manufacture concrete pressure pipe, prestressed concrete pipe and bar-wrapped concrete pipe in Eastern Canada. Our concrete pressure pipe is used for water transmission and distribution, power plant cooling water lines, sewage force mains for wastewater and storm water and other diverse applications involving the movement of large volumes of water. Concrete-lined pressure pipe ranges from fourteen to 144 inches in diameter. Prestressed concrete pipe consists of a concrete core, a steel cylinder and a high tensile strength wire that is wrapped, under measured tension and at uniform spacing, around the steel cylinder. This wire wrap places the steel cylinder and concrete core in compression, developing the pipe’s ability to withstand specified hydrostatic pressures and external loads. An outside coating of mortar protects the wires. Bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe combines the physical strength of steel with the structural and protective properties of high strength cement mortar. In this type of pipe, a round steel bar is helically wound around a welded steel cylinder and all surfaces are encased in cement mortar. This composite pipe reacts as a unit when resisting internal pressure and external loads. The inside of the cylinder is lined with centrifugally cast cement mortar.
Our concrete pressure pipe is highly engineered and is built to order for technically demanding applications requiring various thresholds of working pressure, surge pressure and loads. Our engineers work closely with customers to design components and systems to meet specific regulatory and industrial demands.
In addition to our operations, we have a 50% equity interest in Concrete Pipe & Precast LLC, or CP&P, a joint venture with Eagle Corporation. CP&P operates 12 plants that serve the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. CP&P manufactures drainage pipe and precast concrete products and sells those products to similar types of customers as the ones to which we market. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding CP&P.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Utilizing the U.S. Pipe brand, we manufacture a number of products used for the transmission of potable water and wastewater in pipe diameters ranging from three to 64 inches.
We manufacture DIP in pipe diameters ranging from three to 64 inches in the United States. For each diameter of pipe, we offer a wide range of thicknesses with both standard and specialized linings and coatings. DIP is used for transmission and distribution of potable water and wastewater and is typically utilized for smaller diameter applications of 24 inches and smaller. DIP has residential and infrastructure repair replacement applications, including potable water distribution systems, small water system grids, major water transmission mains, wastewater collection systems, sewer force mains and water treatment plants. In addition to DIP, we also manufacture a full line of complementary joint restraints and fittings in Mexico, which are utilized for interlocking adjoining segments of pipe and are typically bundled with DIP. We also operate fabrication plants that modify our pipe to meet specific customer design requirements for above-ground applications.
DIP is manufactured using a process that consists of introducing molten iron into a rapidly-rotating steel mold and relying on centrifugal force to distribute the molten iron evenly around the inner surface of the mold to produce pipe of uniform size and dimensions. We also strive to innovate in our Water Pipe & Products segment, including by offering metallic zinc coating and TR-XTREME pipe. Metallic zinc coating is active corrosion protection for DIP. TR-XTREME pipe is DIP designed for areas of seismic activity and has joints that provide flexible extension capabilities.
Customers and Markets
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
We typically sell our drainage pipe and precast products to contractors that perform construction work for various levels of government, residential and non-residential building owners, and developers in markets across the United States and Eastern Canada. Additionally, although they are not our direct customers, we view the owners and engineers who are customers of the contractors that purchase our products as our customers as well, because these owners and engineers often specify the types of products that our customers are required to use. We also sell our drainage pipe and precast products to utility companies. Several of our largest manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to our markets. Our drainage pipe and precast products are typically shipped within a radius of 150 miles, but in some cases up to 350 miles, from our manufacturing facilities. Our pressure pipe is used in projects for regional water authorities and districts, cities, counties, municipalities, port authorities, private companies and industrial clients, including power plants.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Our water transmission pipe products are sold to some of the largest waterworks distributors and contractors. Our Water Pipe & Products segment has significant sales through distributors, including Core & Main, a key customer that accounted for 16% and 15% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also sell to utility contractors that work on new or replacement pipeline projects, primarily in the East, South and Midwest of the United States. DIP is typically shipped within a radius of 1,000 miles and concrete pressure pipe is typically shipped within a radius of 500 miles from our manufacturing facilities.
Competition
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
Our competitors in our Drainage Pipe & Products Segment include Rinker Materials (a division of the QUIKRETE Companies) and Oldcastle Infrastructure (a unit of CRH plc), as well as numerous regional and local manufacturers. Additionally, our drainage pipe products compete with high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polypropylene pipe products where such materials would serve as an appropriate substitute for our product.
Within Canada, our concrete pressure pipe products compete with DECAST (formerly Munro Concrete Products, Ltd.) and several other American and Canadian competitors. Our concrete-lined pressure pipe also competes with pressure pipe made from other materials such as fiberglass, HDPE and PVC.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Our two largest competitors in DIP manufacturing are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Our DIP products also compete with polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, and HDPE pipe and, when pricing achieves certain levels, we may also compete with foreign manufacturers of DIP. Our national network of fabrication products competes with regional and local providers of those products and services.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Our products are generally made to order, but certain of our products are made to inventory. We have established target levels of inventory for certain products that we attempt to keep available at our manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand. Inventories are held at manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, at distribution yards.
Our structural precast products, most precast concrete products and concrete pressure pipe are customized products that are made to order. Our order backlog for precast concrete products is typically two to six months. Our order backlog for concrete pressure pipe and other precast offerings (bridge products) is approximately eight months.
We seek to attract and retain customers through customer service and technical expertise, as well as product quality, our product and service offerings and competitive pricing. Our market strategy for products with non-residential end users is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships rather than traditional advertising.
We maintain in-house technical sales, engineering and field service teams which provide customers technical expertise and support to assist them in finding the right product or solution for their specific need. Each of our operating segments has its own sales force. Overall, we employ more than 300 sales and related support professionals. Our sales force and customer service functions are staffed by experienced professionals who have been trained in our product lines, processes and systems, and who maintain touch points with engineers, contractors, builders, and distributors. Additionally, we have a staff of more than 130 engineers that we employ to work in concert with our sales force to help develop effective product solutions for our customers.
We sell our DIP products and our fittings and fabricated products primarily through distributors. Our drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and precast concrete products are mostly sold direct to customers who are installing such products for or are the end users of such products. Drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and certain precast products are sold through a bidding process in which we seek to place the most competitive bid. We undertake marketing efforts through our participation in trade shows and through our website. We outsource many of our product deliveries by using a combination of dedicated carriers and other third-party carriers.
Raw Materials and Inputs
The primary material for our drainage pipe and precast concrete products and our concrete pressure pipe is concrete, which consists of water, cement and aggregates. Another key input for our products is steel, which is used to provide reinforcement within our drainage pipe and precast concrete products. Our DIP is largely made from iron melted from recycled scrap metals. Other key materials for our DIP include foundry coke and certain additives, such as alloys.
Most of our raw materials are widely available commodities. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials. To the extent we do not produce any raw materials, when and where possible, we try to purchase raw materials from the source, and because of their low value-to-weight ratios, we generally try to source our raw materials in the vicinity of our facilities. We usually purchase the raw materials we need in the spot market, except where we anticipate a significant need of materials for a specific project. Other than certain contracts for key materials, including cement and steel, we typically do not enter into long-term supply contracts with our suppliers that require us to purchase particular quantities or to pay particular prices.
We purchase our steel from a number of different suppliers, but most suppliers are based in the United States in order to comply with “Buy America” government contract requirements placed on our customers. We endeavor to purchase these steel supplies from the entity which is as close as possible to the manufacturer.
To manufacture DIP, fabricated products and fittings, we purchase scrap metal directly from qualified scrap sources near our foundry sites in the United States and Mexico. We utilize certain categories of scrap metal, primarily shredded automobile bodies, plate & structural, and cast iron. We purchase foundry coke from two merchant coke producers in the United States, both located in Birmingham, Alabama. Major alloys and additives are procured from both domestic and foreign sources based on a semiannual bid process.
Seasonality
The construction industry, and therefore demand for our products, is typically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For a more detailed discussion, see the sections titled Item 1A.","Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Industry and End Markets
Our business is based in significant part on government-funded infrastructure projects and building activities, and any reductions or re-allocation of spending or related subsidies in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our business depends heavily on government spending for infrastructure and other similar building activities. As a result, demand for many of our products is heavily influenced by U.S. and Canadian federal government fiscal policies and tax incentives and other subsidies, as well as state and municipal funding of projects. The infrastructure projects in which we participate are typically funded directly by governments and/or privately-funded but are otherwise tied to or impacted by government policies and spending measures. Government infrastructure spending and governmental policies with respect thereto depend primarily on the availability of public funds, which is influenced by many factors, including governmental budgets, public debt levels, interest rates, existing and anticipated and actual federal, state, provincial and municipal tax revenues, government leadership and the general political climate, as well as other general macroeconomic and political factors. In addition, U.S. federal government funds may only be available based on states’ willingness to provide matching funding, and state funding may not be available, particularly in light of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on state budgets. As a result, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association forecasts transportation construction activity to decline 5.5 percent in 2021. Government spending is often approved only on a short-term basis and some of the projects in which our products are used require longer-term funding commitments. If government funding is not approved or funding is lowered, whether as a result of poor economic conditions, lower than expected revenues, competing spending priorities or other factors, it could limit infrastructure projects available, increase competition for projects, result in excess inventory and decrease sales, any of which could adversely affect the profitability of our business.
Additionally, certain regions or states may require or possess the means to finance only a limited number of large infrastructure projects and periods of high demand may be followed by years of little to no activity. There can be no assurances that governments will sustain or increase current infrastructure spending and tax incentive and other subsidy levels, and any reductions thereto or delays therein could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Residential and non-residential construction activity is cyclical and influenced by many factors, and any reduction in the activity in one or both of these markets could have a material adverse effect on us.
Historically, demand for our products has been closely tied to residential construction and non-residential construction in the United States and Eastern Canada. Our success and future growth prospects depend, to a significant extent, on conditions in these two markets and the degree to which these markets are strong in the future.
The construction industry and related markets are cyclical and have in the past been, and may in the future be, materially and adversely affected by general economic and global financial market conditions. These factors impact not only our business, but those of our customers and suppliers as well. This influence is true with respect to macroeconomic factors within North America, particularly within our geographic footprint in the United States and Eastern Canada. For example, in 2008, residential construction and non-residential construction activity dipped to historically low levels during the financial crisis. As a result, demand for many of our products dropped significantly.
The markets in the construction industry in which we operate are also subject to other more specific factors. Residential construction activity levels are influenced by and sensitive to a number of factors, including mortgage availability, the cost of financing a home (in particular, mortgage terms and interest rates), unemployment levels, household formation rates, gross domestic product, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, demand for second homes, existing housing prices, rental prices, housing inventory levels, building mix between single- and multi-family homes, consumer confidence, seasonal weather factors, the available labor pool and government regulation, policy and incentives. Non-residential construction activity is primarily driven by levels of business investment, availability of credit and interest rates, as well as many of the factors that impact residential construction activity levels.
We cannot control the foregoing factors, we cannot be certain that residential and non-residential construction activity will remain at current levels, and there can be no assurances regarding whether any growth in these markets can be sustained. If construction activity in our markets, and more generally, does remain at
current levels, or if there are future downturns, whether locally, regionally or nationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We engage in a highly competitive business and any failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on us.
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We face significant competition from, depending on the segment or product, domestic and imported products produced by local, regional, national and international building product manufacturers, as well as privately owned single-site enterprises. Due in part to the costs associated with transporting our products to our customers, many of our sub-markets are relatively fragmented and include a number of regional competitors. Our competitors include Rinker Materials (a division of QUIKRETE) and Oldcastle Infrastructure (a division of CRH plc), as well as numerous regional and local competitors, in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment and McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company in our Water Pipe & Products segment, particularly with respect to DIP.
Competition among manufacturers in our markets is based on many factors with significant emphasis on price. Our competitors may sell their products at lower prices because, among other things, they possess the ability to manufacture or supply similar products and services more efficiently or at a lower cost or have built a superior sales or distribution network. Some of our competitors may have access to greater financial or other resources than we do, which may afford them greater purchasing power, greater production efficiency, increased financial flexibility or more capital resources for expansion and improvement. In addition, some of our competitors are vertically integrated with suppliers or distributors and can leverage this structure to their advantage to offer better pricing to customers. Furthermore, our competitors’ actions, including restoring idled or expanding manufacturing capacity, or the entry of new competitors into one or more of our markets, particularly in the Drainage business where there are low barriers to entry, could cause us to lower prices in an effort to maintain our customer base. For example, the pricing impact of a new competitor entering the Houston, Texas Drainage market in 2017 had a negative impact on revenues. Certain of our products, including gravity pipe, are volume manufacturing products that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors, with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants’ perceptions of short-term supply and demand. Competitive factors, including industry overcapacity, could also lead to pricing pressures. For example, competitors may choose to pursue a volume policy to continue utilizing their manufacturing facilities or in attempt to gain market share, each to the detriment of maintaining prices. Excess product supply can result in significant declines in the market prices for these products, often within a short period of time. As a result, at times, to remain competitive, we may lower the price for any one or more of our products to or below our production costs, requiring us to sacrifice margins or incur losses. Alternatively, we may choose to forgo product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities. Conversely, at times when prices are maintained at higher levels, there is greater risk that foreign competitors may enter one or more of our markets, particularly with respect to DIP.
In addition to pricing, we also compete based on service, quality, range of products and product availability. Our competitors may be positioned to provide better service and thereby establish stronger relationships with customers and suppliers. Our competitors may also sell preferred products, improve the design and performance of their products, develop a more comprehensive product portfolio, be better positioned to influence end-user product specifications or introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics. While the majority of our products are not subject to frequent or rapid stylistic changes, trends do evolve over time, and our competitors may do a better job of predicting market developments or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.
We also face competition from substitute and newly designed building products. For example, storm water pipe can be manufactured from concrete, steel, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and potable water transmission infrastructure can be manufactured using HDPE or PVC. The market share of HDPE and PP pipe, which compete with gravity pipe and concrete pressure pipe for certain applications, and HDPE and PVC pipe, which compete with DIP for certain applications, have increased in recent years. Governments in the past have, and may continue in the future, to provide incentives that support or encourage, or in certain instances pass regulations that require, the consideration or use of substitute products with which we compete. Lower costs and pricing of substitute products may challenge our ability to achieve
pricing for our products at a level that is consistent with our business plans. Some of the substitute products with which we compete may also offer longer warranties than our typical product warranty, and we may face competitive pressures to offer longer warranties on our products, which could increase our exposure to claims in future years or cause us to lose business. Additionally, new construction techniques and materials will likely be developed in the future. Increases in customer or market preferences for any of these products could lead to a reduction in demand for our products, limit our ability to raise prices or otherwise adversely impact our competitive position.
Any failure by us to compete on price or service, to develop successful products and strategies or to generally maintain and improve our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in construction activity levels in Texas could have a material adverse effect on us.
We currently conduct a significant portion of our business in Texas, which we estimate represented approximately 18% and 20% of our 2020 and 2019 net sales, respectively. Government-funded infrastructure spending, as well as residential and non-residential construction activity in each of these areas has declined from time to time, particularly as a result of slow economic growth, whether in the energy industry or otherwise. Local economic conditions depend on a variety of factors, including national economic conditions, local and state budgets, infrastructure spending and the impact of federal cutbacks. In addition, Texas is susceptible to severe weather and flooding, which can interrupt, delay or otherwise impact the timing of projects. Any decrease in construction activity in Texas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A tightening of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements or other reductions in the availability of consumer credit or increases in its cost could have a material adverse effect on us.
We depend on net sales generated from residential construction activity. Most home sales in the U.S. and Eastern Canada are financed through mortgage loans, and a significant percentage of renovation and other home repair activity is financed either through mortgage loans or other available credit. The financial crisis affected the financial position of many consumers and caused financial institutions to tighten their lending criteria, each of which contributed to a significant reduction in the availability of consumer credit. These developments resulted in a significant reduction in total new housing starts in the U.S. and consequently, a reduction in demand for our products in the residential sector. Similarly, the rate of interest payable on any mortgage or other form of credit will have an impact on the cost of borrowing. While base rates have remained relatively low in recent years, they may rise in the future, which would increase the cost of borrowing, making the purchase of a home less attractive, which could reduce the number of new housing starts in the U.S. and Eastern Canada. Any future tightening of mortgage lending or other reductions in the availability of consumer credit or increases in its cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business
Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price have been and in the future may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our operations and business have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially and adversely affected, whether directly or indirectly, by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting weakening of economic conditions in the United States and eastern Canada. Local, state, provincial and federal governmental authorities initially responded to the pandemic by implementing increasingly stringent measures in geographies where we operate to help control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on movement such as quarantines, “shelter in place,” “stay at home” orders, and travel restrictions, as well as restricting or prohibiting outright some or all forms of commercial and business activity, and other restrictions, including closures of school and childcare facilities. Certain states have also enacted regulations that authorize local officials to close businesses where there if a lack of safety precautions in place or signs that transmission of the virus at the workplace has occurred.
Although we were and have continued to be categorized as “essential” and therefore permitted to operate our facilities consistent with applicable local, state, provincial and federal orders, any changes in these governmental orders, including the imposition of new orders, changes to the extent or the duration thereof, or any further, more severe, actions taken by governmental authorities or that we may choose to take whether required or not could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Our customers have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of project delays and other adverse impacts on demand, which could result in adverse impacts on our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, our suppliers and other parts of our supply chain could experience disruptions and other adverse impacts as a result of the pandemic that could cause us to be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies on a timely or cost-effective basis, or in some cases, at all, any of which could result in our being unable to service our customers’ demands, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic, including any actions we have taken in response, has disrupted our internal operations, including by heightening the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise not be permitted or be unable to work, and required that certain of our employees work remotely, which has heightened certain risks, including those related to cybersecurity and internal controls. For example, during the second quarter of 2020, a small number of employees tested positive for COVID-19, which required us to temporarily close a small number of our manufacturing facilities, and during the third and fourth quarters we experienced increasing numbers of employees who tested positive for COVID-19 and were required to quarantine. Additionally, we cannot predict whether these conditions and concerns will continue or whether we will experience more significant or frequent disruptions in the future, including the complete closure of one or more of our facilities, which could cause delays in our ability to produce and deliver products to our customers and cause us to suffer reputational harm and incur penalties and other types of damages if we are not able to meet contractual obligations. In addition, in the event demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts, we may need to assess different corporate actions and cost-cutting measures, including reducing our workforce or closing one or more facilities, and these actions could cause us to incur costs and expose us to other risks and inefficiencies, including whether we would be able to rehire our workforce or recommence operations at a given facility if our business experiences a subsequent recovery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected economies worldwide and significantly disrupted financial and other capital markets, causing a significant deceleration of economic activity. This slowdown has decreased demand for a wide variety of goods and services, diminished trade levels, reduced production and led to widespread corporate downsizing, causing a sharp increase in unemployment. The impact of this outbreak on the U.S. and world economies is uncertain and, unless until the outbreak is contained, these adverse impacts could worsen, impacting all segments of the global economy, and result in a significant recession or worse. Although we initially took certain precautionary measures to preserve liquidity, including borrowing under our ABL Facility and suspending non-essential capital expenditures, we have since ended these measures and repaid the amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility, and a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations or other pressures on our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition, the achievement of our strategic objectives or require us to seek additional capital. Conditions in the financial and capital markets have been extremely volatile and may limit or entirely restrict the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the COVID-19 virus and the pandemic's potential effects, and the extent and effectiveness of responses taken on local, national and global levels. No fully effective vaccines or treatments have been developed and one may not be discovered early enough to protect against a worsening of the pandemic or to prevent COVID-19 from becoming endemic. While we expect the pandemic and related events will continue to have a negative effect on us, the unpredictable and unprecedented nature and fluidity of current circumstances makes it impractical to identify all potential risks or estimate the full extent and scope of the impact on our business and industry, as well as national, regional and global markets and economies. However, our ability to conduct our business in the manner previously or currently expected could be materially and adversely affected, and any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties as well as those that have not yet manifested
themselves or been identified could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our dependence on key customers with whom we do not have long-term contracts and consolidation within our customers’ industries could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our business is dependent on certain key customers. In 2020 and 2019, Core & Main, our largest customer accounted for 16% and 15% of our net sales, respectively. As is customary in our industry, we do not enter into long-term contracts with many of our customers. As a result, our customers could stop purchasing our products, reduce their purchase levels or request reduced pricing structures at any time. We may therefore need to adapt our manufacturing, pricing and marketing strategies in response to a customer who may seek concessions in return for its continued or increased business. In addition, a macroeconomic downturn or any other cause of consolidation in the U.S. homebuilding industry or among our other customers, as occurred during the financial crisis when a number of smaller businesses went out of business or were acquired, can significantly increase the market share and bargaining power of a limited number of customers and give them significant additional leverage to negotiate more favorable terms and place greater demands on us. A loss of one or more customers or a meaningful reduction in their purchases from us or further consolidation within our end markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The seasonality of our business and its susceptibility to severe and prolonged periods of adverse weather and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.
Demand for our products in some markets is typically seasonal, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For example, sales of our products in Canada and the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States are somewhat higher from spring through autumn when construction activity is greatest. Construction activity declines in these markets during the winter months in particular due to inclement weather, frozen ground and fewer hours of daylight. Construction activity can also be affected in any period by adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, severe storms, torrential rains and floods, natural disasters such as fires and earthquakes and similar events, any of which could reduce demand for our products, push back existing orders to later dates or lead to cancellations. Furthermore, our ability to deliver products on time or at all to our customers can be significantly impeded by such conditions and events, such as those described above. Public holidays and vacation periods constitute an additional factor that may exacerbate certain seasonality effects, as building projects or industrial manufacturing processes may temporarily cease. These conditions, particularly when unanticipated, can leave both equipment and personnel underutilized. Additionally, the seasonal nature of our business has led to variation in our quarterly results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. This general seasonality of our business and any severe or prolonged adverse weather conditions or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The use of our products is often affected by various laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate, any of which may have a material adverse effect on us.
The use of many of our products is subject to approvals by municipalities, state departments of transportation, engineers and developers. These approvals and specifications, including building codes, may affect the products our customers or their customers (the end users) are allowed or choose to use, and, consequently, failure to obtain or maintain such approvals or changes in building codes may affect the saleability of our products. Changes in applicable regulations governing the sale of some of our products or the failure of any of our products to comply with such requirements could increase our costs of doing business, reduce sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with any current or future laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.
We are subject to federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and natural resources, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges and the use, storage, discharge, handling, disposal, transport and cleanup of solid and hazardous materials and
wastes. We are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations, and if we expand or modify our facilities or if environmental laws change, we could be required to obtain new or modified permits.
Environmental laws and regulations, including those related to energy use and climate change, tend to become more stringent over time, and any future laws and regulations could have a material impact on our operations or require us to incur material additional expenses to comply with any such future laws and regulations. Future environmental laws and regulations may cause us to modify how we manufacture and price our products or require that we make significant capital investments to comply. For example, our manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, and increased regulation of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse gases could materially increase our manufacturing costs or require us to install emissions control or other equipment at some or all of our manufacturing facilities.
If we fail to comply with any existing or future environmental laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions and suffer reputational harm. In addition, we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from claims or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to any exposure to or release of hazardous materials or contamination at our facilities, whether presently or previously leased, operated, or owned, or at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be subject to third-party claims from individuals for property damage, personal injury or nuisance if any releases from our property were to cause contamination of the air, soil or groundwater of areas near our facilities. These laws and regulations may also require us to investigate and, in certain instances, remediate contamination. Some of our sites have a history of industrial use, and while we apply strict environmental operating standards and undertake extensive environmental due diligence in relation to our facilities and acquisitions, some soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at a limited number of sites.
As of December 31, 2020, we had accrued approximately $1.6 million for environmental liabilities. Additionally, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of future contamination. Any costs or other damage related to existing or future environmental laws, regulations or permits or any violations thereof could expose us to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to health and safety laws and regulations, and the costs to comply with, or any failure to comply with, any current or future laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.
Manufacturing sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Our sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, heavy products and items and highly regulated materials. As a result, we are subject to a variety of health and safety laws and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs. Our safety record can also impact our reputation. We maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective work procedures throughout our organization and take other steps to ensure the health and safety of our work force, but there can be no assurances these measures or other measures we may take in the future will be successful in preventing injuries, including severe injuries and fatalities, or violations of health and safety laws and regulations. Any failure to maintain safe work sites or violations of applicable law could expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Warranty and related claims could have a material adverse effect on us.
We generally provide warranties on our products against defects in materials and workmanship, the costs of which could be significant. Many of our products such as gravity pipe are buried underground and incorporated into a larger infrastructure system, such as a city’s or municipality’s water transmission system, or built into the fabric of a building or dwelling. In most cases, it is difficult to access, repair, recall or replace these products. Additionally, some of our products, such as our pressure pipe, which is used in nuclear and coal-fired power generation factories, are used in applications where a product failure or construction defect could result in significant project delay, property damage, personal injury or death or could require significant remediation
expenses. Because our products, including discontinued products, are long lasting, claims can also arise many years after their manufacture and sale. In certain cases, we may also offer warranties for longer periods now for certain products to compete with certain substitutes, which could increase the number, size, and frequency of warranty claims in the future. Product failures may also arise due to the quality of the raw materials we purchase from third-party suppliers or the quality of the work performed by our customers, including installation work, matters for which we have little to no control, but which may still subject us to a warranty claim. We may also assume product warranty or other similar obligations in acquisition transactions regarding the products sold by the acquired businesses prior to the transaction date for which we are not indemnified pursuant to the terms of the relevant transaction documentation. Our quality control systems and procedures and those of our suppliers and customers cannot test for all possible conditions of use or identify all defects in the design, engineering or specifications of one of our products or the raw materials we use before they are put to their intended purpose. Therefore, there can be no assurances that we will not supply defective or inferior products that cause product or system failure, which could give rise to potentially extensive warranty and other claims for damages, as well as negatively impact our reputation and the perception of our product quality and reliability. While we have established reserves for warranty and related claims that we believe to be reasonable, these claims may exceed our reserves and any such excess and any negative publicity and other issues related to such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Sharing our brand name and logo could have a material adverse effect on us.
We share the “Forterra” brand with the operator of HeidelbergCement's former building products business in the United Kingdom, or Forterra UK, a public company listed on the London FTSE. Forterra UK is no longer affiliated with us and, to our knowledge, operates solely in the United Kingdom. We have no control over Forterra UK’s use of the “Forterra” name and logo in Europe. Any actions or negative publicity related to Forterra UK and its products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
HeidelbergCement asserted a claim against us related to the payment of an earnout in connection with the Acquisition and any payment we are required to make could have a material adverse effect on us.
HeidelbergCement asserted a $100.0 million claim against us regarding the earnout provision in the purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition. As discussed in greater detail in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” The neutral accounting arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding ruled against Heidelberg and found that no earnout amount was owed. We believe that the time has expired for Heidelberg to assert any objection to that ruling without such objection having been asserted, but if Heidelberg were to seek to overturn the ruling and be successful, we may not have sufficient cash to make such payment and may be required to incur additional indebtedness.
Production, Supply Chain and Systems Related Risks
Decreased availability of or increases in the cost of raw materials, including through the impacts of trade policy, could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our ability to offer our products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials at reasonable costs, such as cement, aggregate, steel and scrap iron. Raw material prices for certain raw materials that are key to our products, such as steel and scrap metal, have been volatile in recent years. In particular, changes in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of any tariffs by the U.S. or foreign governments, may negatively impact the availability and price of raw materials used in our production. In particular, in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government imposed tariffs and quotas on certain imported steel articles, and other countries, such as Canada, have implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including steel. These actions, which are for an indefinite period of time, resulted in increased prices for both U.S. and non-U.S. steel, one of our main raw material inputs, and the continued imposition of these tariffs, increases in tariff rates, additional tariffs on other goods, or further retaliatory actions from other governments may result in higher costs for us, and there can be no assurance we will be able to pass any of the increases in raw material costs directly
resulting from the tariff to our customers. Such actions may also result in more difficulty or the inability to obtain needed materials.
Suppliers are also subject to their own viability concerns from economic, market and other pressures. In particular, many suppliers may decrease capacity during financial downturns or due to other market factors such as depressed prices. This decreased capacity, along with strong global demand for certain raw materials, has at times caused and may continue to cause tighter supply and significant price increases. Factors such as adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters, as well as political and other social instability, have and will continue to disrupt raw material supplies and impact prices.
Although we have agreements with our raw material suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice or contain prices that are based upon the volume of our total purchases. To the extent agreements with any of our raw material suppliers are terminated or we need to purchase additional raw materials in the open market, there can be no assurance that we could timely find alternative sources in reasonable quantities or at reasonable prices. In addition, sudden or unanticipated changes in sources for certain raw materials, such as cement, may require us to engage in testing of our products for quality assurance, which may cause delays in our ability to meet production schedule for our customers and timely deliver our products. Changes in U.S. trade policy and reactions of other governments to those changes could also negatively impact the availability of certain raw materials, such as steel, as the demand for U.S. steel could increase as a result of these changes. The inability to obtain any raw materials or unanticipated changes with respect to our suppliers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or deliver our products and to meet customer demands.
We are susceptible to raw material price fluctuations. In recent years, prices of the raw materials we use have at times fluctuated and may be susceptible to significant price fluctuations in the future. We have hedged our positions with respect to certain raw materials in the past and may do so in the future, but we currently have no hedging in place regarding our raw material needs and are therefore more susceptible to any short-term price fluctuations. We generally attempt to pass increased costs, including higher raw material prices and government imposed costs, on to our customers, but the timing between acceptance of a customer order and the purchase of raw materials needed to fulfill such order, pricing pressure from our competitors, the market power of our customers or other pricing factors may limit our ability to pass on such price increases. If we cannot fully-offset increases in the cost of raw materials through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or otherwise, we could experience lower margins and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A material disruption or capacity constraints at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on us.
We own and operate manufacturing facilities of various ages and levels of automated control and rely on a number of third parties as part of our supply chain, including for the efficient distribution of products to our customers. Any disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities or within our supply chain could prevent us from meeting demand or require us to incur unplanned capital expenditures. Older facilities and equipment are generally less energy efficient and are at an increased risk of breakdown or equipment failure, resulting in unplanned downtime. Any unplanned downtime at our facilities may cause delays in meeting customer timelines, result in damages claims, including liquidated damages, or cause us to lose or harm customer relationships. Additionally, we require specialized equipment to manufacture certain products, and if any of our manufacturing equipment fails, the time required to repair or replace this equipment could be lengthy, which could result in extended downtime at the affected facility. Any unplanned repair or replacement work can also be very expensive. Moreover, manufacturing facilities can unexpectedly stop operating because of events unrelated to us or beyond our control, including fires and other industrial accidents, floods and other severe weather events, natural disasters, environmental incidents or other catastrophes, utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions, shortages of raw materials, and acts of war or terrorism. Work stoppages, whether union-organized or not, can also disrupt operations at manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, we are generally responsible for delivering products to the customer and, while we deliver a small percentage of our products directly to the customer using our own fleet, we outsource this function and depend on third parties to deliver the vast majority of our products, primarily by truck with some reliance on rail where possible. Any shortages in trucking or rail capacity or any
increase in the cost thereof, whether as a result of strikes, slowdowns, a shortage of drivers, other disruption to the highway or rail systems, or other unrelated transportation issues could limit our ability to deliver our products in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all. Any material disruption at one or more of our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers or otherwise within our supply chain, whether as a result of downtime, facility damage, an inability to deliver our products or otherwise, could prevent us from meeting demand, require us to incur unplanned capital expenditures or cause other material disruption to our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Delays in construction projects and any failure to manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on us.
Many of our products are used in water transmission and distribution projects and other large-scale construction projects which generally require a significant amount of planning and preparation before construction commences. However, construction projects can be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including unanticipated soil conditions, adverse weather or flooding, changes in project priorities, financing issues, difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations or obtaining permits and additional time required to acquire rights-of-way or property rights. These delays or reschedulings may occur with too little notice to allow us to replace those projects in our manufacturing schedules or to adjust production capacity accordingly, creating unplanned downtime, increased costs and inefficiencies in our operations and increased levels of excess or obsolete inventory. Additionally, we maintain an inventory of certain products that meet standard specifications and are ultimately purchased by a variety of end users. However, our demand forecasts are not always accurate and unexpected changes in demand for these products, whether project-driven, because of a change in preferences or otherwise, can lead to increased levels of excess or obsolete inventory. Any delays in construction projects and our customers’ orders or any inability to manage our inventory, which can lead to impairment charges, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increased costs of energy could have a material adverse effect on us.
We use significant amounts of energy, including electricity and natural gas, in the manufacturing, transportation, distribution and sale of our products, and the related expense is significant. While we have benefited from the relatively low cost of electricity and natural gas in recent years, energy prices have been and may continue to be volatile and these reduced prices may not continue. Proposed or existing government policies, including those to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased energy costs. In addition, factors such as international political and military instability, adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters may disrupt fuel supplies and increase prices in the future. Additionally, because we and other manufacturers in our industry are often responsible for delivering products to the customer, we are further exposed to increased energy prices as a component of our transportation costs. While we generally attempt to pass increased costs, including higher energy costs, on to our customers, pricing pressure from our competitors, the market power of our customers or other pricing factors may limit our ability to do so, and any increases in energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted based on disruptions, delays, outages of our information technology systems and computer networks.
Our manufacturing facilities as well as our sales and service activities depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated information technology systems and computer networks, which are subject to failure and disruption. These and other problems may be caused by system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, human error, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other similar events. Additionally, because we have grown through various acquisitions, we have integrated and are integrating a number of disparate information technology systems across our organization, certain of which may be outdated and due for replacement, further increasing the likelihood of problems. We may in the future replace and integrate systems or
implement new technology systems, but these updates may not be successful, they may create new issues we currently do not face, or significantly exceed our cost estimates.
We outsource certain portions of the operations of our information technology systems to a third party. Any failure of us or of our third party provider to effectively operate such systems could cause a disruption in our information technology systems. Any disruption in our information technology systems could interrupt or damage our operations and our ability to meet customer needs as well as our ability to maintain effective controls. These events could damage our reputation and cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, including financial losses from remedial actions, business interruptions, loss of business and other unanticipated costs which may not be covered by insurance. Despite the defensive measures we have taken to protect our data and information technology, our systems could be vulnerable to disruption and any such disruption and the resulting fallout could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employee Specific Risks
Labor disruptions and other union activity could have a material adverse effect on us.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 33% of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 24% of these employees were included in collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire within one year. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Such actions at any one of our facilities could lead to a plant shut down or a substantial modification to employment terms, thereby causing us to lose net sales or incur increased costs. We have not had any recent union-organized work stoppages in the United States, Canada or Mexico; however, we have experienced one union organizing effort directed at our non-union employees in the past ten years. There can be no assurances there will not be additional union organizing efforts, strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages in the future. Any such disruption, or other issue related to union activity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend on the services of key executives and any inability to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our key management personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business and identifying expansion opportunities. Additionally, as our business grows, we may need to attract and hire additional management personnel. We have employment agreements with some members of senior management; however, we cannot prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us, and any replacements we hire may not be as effective. Further, we have undergone some changes at the senior management level, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and any transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition to new personnel could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance. While we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with changes our senior management team, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees, customers and others concerning our future direction and performance. Our ability to retain our key management personnel or to attract additional management personnel or suitable replacements when needed is dependent on a number of factors, including the competitive nature of the employment market. Any failure to retain key management personnel or to attract additional or suitable replacement personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any failure by us or the contractors with which we work to retain and attract necessary personnel or contract labor could have a material adverse effect on us.
Competition for hiring new and retaining existing qualified personnel is intense and our success depends in part on our ability to retain, attract and train necessary personnel, including engineering and other skilled technical personnel. Our experienced sales team has also developed a number of meaningful customer
relationships that would be difficult to replace. We compete with other companies for many employees in hourly positions, which have historically had high turnover rates. Without a sufficient number of qualified employees in each of these areas, the productivity and profitability of our operations and manufacturing quality could suffer. Additionally, our business relies on the ability of the contractors who install our products to obtain qualified employees, including experienced supervisors and foreman, and a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel could cause delays in customer’s ability to take shipments of our products.
Labor shortages may impact our ability to hire skilled or unskilled workers with the necessary experience. For example, the reduction in demand for products in our industry during the financial crisis led to a number of both skilled and unskilled workers leaving our industry permanently, reducing an already limited pool of available and qualified personnel. Furthermore, unemployment has declined in recent years, reaching historically low levels in the United States, which has further tightened the labor market. If new or more restrictive immigration legislation is enacted at the federal level or in states in which we do business, or if existing regulations are interpreted or enforced differently, these changes could further tighten certain labor markets.
If we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining the necessary workforce, we may incur additional costs to run our business. Many of these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. Our ability to control labor costs is also subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages, regulations governing payment of workers.
There can be no assurances the labor pool from which we or the contractors with whom we work hire will increase or remain stable, nor that we will be able to control labor costs. Any failure by us or the contractors with which we work to retain our existing personnel or attract and train additional qualified personnel at reasonable costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Miscellaneous Business Risks
Cybersecurity attacks may threaten our confidential information, disrupt operations and result in harm to our reputation and adversely impact our business and financial performance.
Cybersecurity attacks across industries, including ours, are increasing in sophistication and frequency and may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to measures targeted specifically at us. These attacks include but are not limited to, malicious software or viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information systems, attempts to gain unauthorized access to business, proprietary or other confidential information, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Cybersecurity failures may be caused by employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, and their products. We have been subject to cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of our IT systems that exposed certain confidential business information as well as ransomware attacks on non-critical business systems. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may experience these and different types of attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication.
Failures of our IT systems as a result of cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions could result in a breach of critical operational or financial controls and lead to a disruption of our operations, commercial activities or financial processes. Cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions impacting significant customers and/or suppliers could also lead to a disruption of our operations or commercial activities. Despite our attempts to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Legal and regulatory claims and proceedings could have a material adverse effect on us.
We are subject to claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. For example, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims for product liability, construction defects, project delay, personal injury, property and other damages as well as allegations regarding compliance with mandated product specifications. Claims and proceedings, whether or not they have merit and regardless of the outcome, are typically expensive and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time. Additionally, claims and proceedings can impact customer confidence and the general public’s perception of our company and products, even if the underlying assertions are proven to be false.
We are also currently a defendant, together with several of our current and former officers and directors, in a shareholder derivative suit, and in the past have been a defendant in other similar suits, each filed by plaintiffs seeking damages against the Company for allegations of violations of United States laws regulating securities, as discussed in greater detail in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings,"" and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Lawsuits involving us, or our current or former officers and directors, could result in significant expense and divert attention and resources of our management and other key employees. In addition to any damages we may be required to pay, we are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits and related settlement amounts. Such amounts could exceed the coverage provided under our insurance policies.
While we have established reserves we believe to be reasonable under the facts known, the outcomes of litigation and similar disputes are often difficult to reliably predict and may result in decisions or settlements that are contrary to, or in excess of, our expectations, and losses may exceed our reserves. In addition, various factors and developments could lead us to make changes in our current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables or make new or modified estimates as a result of a judicial ruling or judgment, settlement, regulatory development or change in applicable law. Any claims or proceedings, particularly those in which we are unsuccessful or for which we did not establish adequate reserves, could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any inability to successfully acquire businesses in the future could have a material adverse effect on us.
Historically we have grown in large part as a result of acquisitions and our business plan continues to provide for growth in part through acquisitions and joint ventures. Although we expect to regularly consider additional strategic transactions in the future, there can be no assurances that we will identify suitable acquisition, joint venture or other investment opportunities or, if we do, that any transaction can be consummated on acceptable terms. Antitrust or other competition laws may also limit our ability to acquire, or work collaboratively with, certain businesses or to fully realize the benefits of a prospective acquisition or joint venture. Furthermore, changes in our business or the economy, an unexpected decrease in our cash flows or any restrictions imposed by our debt may limit our ability to obtain the necessary capital or otherwise impede our ability to complete a transaction. Regularly considering strategic transactions can also divert management’s attention and lead to significant due diligence and other expenses regardless of whether we pursue or consummate any transaction. Failure to identify suitable transaction partners and to consummate transactions on acceptable terms, as well as the commitment of time and resources in connection with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The consummation of an acquisition also exposes us to significant risks and additional costs. We may not accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses or potential profitability of an acquisition target. Furthermore, we may not be able to fully or successfully integrate an acquired business or realize the expected benefits and synergies following an acquisition. Business and operational overlaps may lead to hidden costs. These costs can include unforeseen pre-acquisition liabilities or the impairment of customer relationships or certain acquired assets such as inventory and goodwill. We may also incur costs and inefficiencies to the extent an acquisition expands the industries, markets or geographies in which we operate due to our limited exposure to and experience in a given industry, market or region. Significant acquisitions may also require that we incur additional debt to finance the transaction, which could be substantial and limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from
operations for other purposes. Acquisitions can also involve post-transaction disputes with the counterparty regarding a number of matters, including a purchase price or other working capital adjustment or liabilities for which we believe we were indemnified under the relevant transaction agreements, such as environmental liabilities or pension or benefit obligations retained by the seller, including certain environmental and benefit obligations in connection with our U.S. Pipe Acquisition and certain pension obligations we assumed pursuant to the Acquisition and our acquisition of Cretex. For example, as discussed in greater detail in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” we are currently engaged in a dispute with HeidelbergCement regarding the earnout provision in the purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition. We are also engaged in other indemnification and other post-closing disputes with certain of our transaction counterparties. Our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as well as other transaction-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In July 2012, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Americast, Inc., now known as Eagle Corporation, to form Concrete Pipe & Precast LLC. From time to time, we may enter into additional joint ventures as part of our growth strategy. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their contractual and other obligations, the affected joint venture may be unable to operate according to its business plan, and we may be required to increase our level of commitment. Differences in views among joint venture participants could also result in delays in business decisions or otherwise, failures to agree on major issues, operational inefficiencies and impasses, litigation or other issues. Third parties may also seek to hold us liable for the joint ventures’ liabilities. These issues or any other difficulties that cause a joint venture to deviate from its original business plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any inability to protect our intellectual property or claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse effect on us.
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade names, confidentiality and nondisclosure clauses and agreements, and other unregistered rights to define and protect our rights to our brand and the intellectual property used in certain of our products, including the innovative technologies relating to storm water management acquired in the Bio Clean Acquisition. We also rely on product, industry, manufacturing and market “know-how” that cannot be registered and may not be subject to any confidentiality or nondisclosure clauses or agreements. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights or our know-how, or claims thereto, will now or in the future successfully protect our intellectual property , or that our rights will not be circumvented or successfully opposed or otherwise challenged. We also cannot guarantee that applications filed will be approved. To the extent that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient, third parties, including competitors, may be able to commercialize our innovations or products or use our know-how. Additionally, we have faced in the past and may in the future face claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, including with respect to both existing and new technologies we use. If any of our products are found to infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of others, our manufacture and sale of such products could be significantly restricted or prohibited and we may be required to pay substantial damages or on-going licensing fees. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights or any misappropriation of the intellectual property of others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on us.
We operate production facilities in Canada and Mexico and we are therefore subject to a number of risks specific to these countries. These risks include social, political and economic instability, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, currency exchange fluctuations, acts of war or terrorism and import/export requirements. In addition, we have a limited number of sales to other foreign jurisdictions, primarily concentrated in the Dominican Republic and Bolivia. Our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with international transactions being translated into U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the Canadian dollar, our U.S. dollar reported net sales and income will decrease. Additionally, since we incur costs in foreign currencies, fluctuation in those currencies’ value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” There can be no
assurances that any of these factors will not materially impact our production cost or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in tax laws could adversely affect us.
We regularly assess our future ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of net operating loss, tax credit and other tax carryforwards, that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on our balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary. A reduction in, or disallowance of, these tax benefits resulting from a legislative change or adverse determination by a taxing jurisdiction could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
Changes in corporate tax rates, the realizability of the net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, or other tax reform legislation, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, (“CARES Act”), could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.
Significant judgment is required in determining our domestic and international provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our tax provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied.
Insufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us.
We maintain property, business interruption, counterparty and liability insurance coverage that we believe is consistent with industry practice. However, our insurance program does not cover, or may not adequately cover, every potential risk associated with our business and the consequences thereof. In addition, market conditions or any significant claim or a number of claims made by or against us could cause our premiums and deductibles to increase substantially and, in some instances, our coverage may be reduced or become entirely unavailable. In the future, we may not be able to obtain meaningful coverage at reasonable rates for a variety of risks, including certain types of environmental hazards and ongoing regulatory compliance. In addition, we self-insure a portion of our exposure to certain matters, including employee health care claims of up to $500,000 per covered individual per year and wage-payment obligations for short-term disability. If our insurance coverage is insufficient, if we are not able to obtain sufficient coverage in the future, or if we are exposed to significant losses as a result of the risks for which we self-insure, any resulting costs or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
As a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404.
Although we currently do not have any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have historically experienced such material weaknesses. To remediate our prior material weaknesses, we have needed to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff, and we may need to do so in the future to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and other controls. Testing and maintaining internal control can
divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.
We are a holding company and depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries.
We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay any future dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to make payments, directly or indirectly, to us in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments. Any inability on the part of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and Liquidity
The terms of our debt could have a material adverse effect on us.
We have substantial debt and may incur additional debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $914.9 million of total debt. Our credit facility contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that generally restrict our business and limit our ability to, among other things:
•dispose of certain assets;
•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;
•enter into new lines of business;
•make investments, intercompany loans or certain payments in respect of indebtedness;
•incur or maintain certain liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions;
•declare or pay dividends and make other restricted payments, including the repurchase or redemption of our stock; and
•engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations and certain asset sales.
In addition, our ability to borrow under the Revolver is limited by the amount of the borrowing base applicable to U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar borrowings. Any negative impact on the elements of our borrowing base, such as eligible accounts receivable and inventory, will reduce our borrowing capacity under the Revolver. Moreover, the Revolver provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional requirements on what accounts receivable and inventory may be counted toward the borrowing base availability, and to impose other reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. The credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information regarding the terms of our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior secured notes dues due 2025. We are also party to a U.S. and a Canadian master lease under which we currently pay an aggregate of $17.1 million and $1.2 million (CAD) per annum, respectively, to lease certain properties through June 30, 2043. Each of these master lease agreements contain certain restrictions and covenants that limit, among other things, our use of and ability to sublease or discontinue use of the leased properties, our ability to consider strategic divestitures of properties that are leased and our ability to consolidate operations as may be appropriate in order to minimize operating costs. See Note 15 in our consolidated financial statements.
These and other similar provisions in these and other documents could have adverse consequences on our business and to our investors because they limit our ability to take these actions even if we believe that it would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. For example, these restrictions could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry, thereby inhibiting our ability to react to markets and potentially making us more vulnerable to downturns. These restrictions could also require that, based on our level of indebtedness, a significant portion of our cash flow from operations be used to make interest payments, thereby reducing the cash flow available for working capital, to fund capital expenditures or other corporate purposes and to generally grow our business. Furthermore, these restrictions could prevent us from pursuing a strategic transaction that we believe would benefit our company.
Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these provisions or any inability to comply with mandated financial ratios could result in a default, in which case the counterparties may have the right to declare all borrowings or other amounts due thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to pay any amounts when due, whether periodic payments, at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the counterparties would have the right to proceed against the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness. Therefore, the restrictions under these agreements and any breach of the covenants or failure to otherwise comply with the terms thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur could have a material adverse effect on us.
We expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur. However, our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and any anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in us being unable to repay indebtedness or our inability to fund other liquidity or strategic needs. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money.
If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our indebtedness that we currently face could intensify. In addition to the risk of higher interest rates and fees, the non-economic terms of any additional indebtedness may contain covenants and other terms restricting our financial, operating and strategic flexibility to an equal or greater extent as those imposed by our credit facility, the indenture governing our senior secured notes dues due 2025 and the master leases. Additional indebtedness may also include cross-default provisions such that, if we breach a restrictive covenant with respect to any of our indebtedness, or an event of default occurs, lenders may be entitled to accelerate all amounts owing under other outstanding indebtedness.
If we are required to refinance our indebtedness or otherwise incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic transactions or otherwise, any additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If, at such time, market conditions are materially different or our credit profile has deteriorated, the cost of refinancing our debt may be significantly higher than our indebtedness existing at that time, or we may not be able to refinance our debt at all. Any failure to meet any future debt service obligations or any inability to obtain any additional financing on terms acceptable to us or to comply therewith could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Credit and non-payment risks of our customers could have a material adverse effect on us.
As is customary in our industry, the majority of our sales are to customers on an open credit basis, with standard payment terms of 30 days. While we generally monitor the ability of our customers to pay these open credit arrangements and limit the credit we extend to what we believe is reasonable based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and payment history, we may still experience losses because of a customer’s inability to pay. As a result, while we maintain what we believe to be a reasonable allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, there is a
risk that our estimates may not be accurate, particularly in times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets. Any inability to collect customer receivables or inadequate provisions for doubtful receivables could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our project-based business requires significant liquidity, and any inability to ensure adequate financing or guarantees for large projects in the future could have a material adverse effect on us.
The projects in which we participate, particularly in our pressure pipe business, can be capital-intensive and often require substantial liquidity levels. In line with industry practice, we receive prepayments from our customers as well as milestone payments. However, a change in prepayment patterns or our inability to obtain third-party guarantees in respect of such prepayments could force us to seek alternative financing sources, such as bank debt or in the capital markets, which we may not be able to do on terms acceptable to us or at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Certain of the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our customers and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings or a good indicator of our future margins, even if performed.
As of December 31, 2020, our backlog totaled approximately $510.2 million. In accordance with industry practice, many of our contracts are subject to cancellation, reduction, termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer in respect of work that has not yet been performed. In the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog, but instead would collect revenues in respect of all work performed at the time of cancellation as well as all other costs and expenses incurred by us through such date. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project, delays in execution of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. Additionally, the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled, terminated or suspended generally increases at times, including as a result of periods of widespread macroeconomic and industry slowdown, weather, seasonality and many of the other factors impacting our business. Many of the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. Therefore, the timing of performance on our individual contracts can affect greatly our margins and hence, future profitability. There is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in any estimated profits.
As is customary in some of our markets, we provide our customers with performance guarantees and other guarantee instruments, such as surety bonds, that guarantee the timely completion of a project pursuant to defined contractual specifications. We also enter into contractual obligations to pay liquidated damages to our customers for project delays. We are required to make payments under these contracts, guarantees and instruments if we fail to meet any of the specifications. Some customers require the performance guarantees to be issued by a reputable and credit worthy financial institution in the form of a letter of credit, surety bond or other financial guarantee. Financial institutions consider our credit ratings and financial position in the guarantee approval process. Our credit ratings and financial position could make the process of obtaining guarantees from financial institutions more difficult and expensive. If we cannot obtain such guarantees from reputable and credit-worthy financial institutions on reasonable terms or at all, we could face higher financing costs or even be prevented from bidding on or obtaining new projects, and any of these or other related obstacles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.
Our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. However, any sale or perception of a possible sale by Lone Star, and any related decline in the market price of our common stock, could impair our ability to raise capital. Separately, additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders
to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.
The phase-out of LIBOR could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us.
LIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market.
Borrowings under our senior term loan and revolver use the London Interbank Offering Rate, or LIBOR, as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom has announced that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. Whether or not SOFR, or another alternative reference rate, attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. Although our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, , those alternative base rates historically would often have led to increased interest rates, in some cases significantly higher, than those we paid based on LIBOR, and may similarly be higher in the future. Therefore, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we will likely need to agree upon a replacement index with our lenders, which would require an amendment to our borrowing arrangements, and the interest rate thereunder will likely change.
The consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. For example, we may not be successful in amending our borrowing arrangements to provide for a replacement rate. If any new or alternative base rate for calculating interest with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may not be as favorable or perform in the same manner as LIBOR and could lead to an increase in our interest expense or could impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness. In addition, the transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in financial markets, which could also have an adverse effect on us whether or not any replacement rate applicable to our borrowings is affected. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other unforeseen impacts, may result in increased interest expense and other expenses, difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks Related to the Proposed Merger
We may not complete the proposed merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could adversely affect our business.
Completion of the merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals or clearances. Regulatory authorities can require conditions on the proposed transaction, including requiring the disposition of certain assets, and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations. Effecting required dispositions can take time to negotiate and complete and there can be no assurances any such dispositions can be negotiated in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. Further, while the parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals, Parent and its affiliates will not be required to take, or agree to take, certain actions with respect to assets, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or the Company or any of its subsidiaries, accounting for more than $80 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, as defined in and measured in accordance with the merger agreement.
Each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is also subject to the absence of any order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger; subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the merger agreement; and the performance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement. Parent’s obligation to consummate the merger is also conditioned on, among other things, the absence of any material adverse effect, as defined in the merger agreement. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including if the merger has not been consummated on or before November 19, 2021, which date will be automatically extended for up to two additional 60-day periods under the circumstances specified in the merger agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that the merger will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the merger agreement or within the expected time frame.
If the merger is not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. We could be required to reimburse certain expenses of Parent or pay Parent a termination fee of $50.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the merger agreement. The failure to complete the merger may result in negative publicity and could negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and strategic partners. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.
The merger agreement provides us with limited remedies in the event of a breach by Parent that results in termination of the merger agreement, including the right to a reverse termination fee payable under certain specified circumstances, as described in the merger agreement. We cannot assure you that a remedy will be available to us in the event of such a breach or that the damages we incur in connection with such breach will not exceed the amount of the reverse termination fee.
Our business is subject to restrictions while the merger is pending.
The merger agreement restricts the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent Parent’s prior written consent. The restrictions on our business activities include, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures above specified levels, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness above specified levels. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding in a timely and effective manner to competitive pressures and industry developments, any of which could adversely affect our business, and financial condition and results of operations.
The announcement and pendency of the merger may disrupt business relationships, lead to employee departures, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
The announcement and pendency of the merger and our efforts to complete the merger could create uncertainty surrounding and significantly disrupt our business. Uncertainty regarding our future could adversely affect our relationship with existing and potential customers, suppliers, vendors, strategic partners or others that deal with us. For example, clients and other counterparties may delay or defer decisions concerning entering into contracts or otherwise working with us, seek to change our existing business relationships or consider doing business with other companies rather than us. Competitors may also target our customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and other risks related to the merger. The pendency of the merger may also divert management’s attention and resources towards completing the merger and preparing for integration actives and away from ongoing business and operations. Uncertainty as to whether the merger will be completed may also
affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the merger. These risks and the resulting adverse effects on business, financial condition and results of operations could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs as a result of the merger.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant direct and indirect costs and expenses in connection with the merger. These costs and expenses include fees for financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems costs in anticipation of consolidation, severance other potential employment-related costs and other transaction costs. We must pay substantially all of these amounts regardless of whether the merger is completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses, including the length of time required to obtain the required regulatory approvals and satisfy the other conditions to closing the merger. If the merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs for which we will have received little or no benefit, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Merger-related legal proceedings could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or otherwise adversely affect us.
Litigation by purported stockholder plaintiffs and others is common in connection with public company acquisitions, regardless of the merits of these claims. The lawsuits often allege, among other things, materially misleading disclosures or omissions in public filings and breaches of fiduciary duties. Any legal proceedings filed in connection with the merger could delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective. For example, the conditions to closing the merger include the absence of any order, injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger and, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any merger-related lawsuit in which a claimant secures injunctive or other relief having the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting completion of the merger, then the merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention away from our regular business, any of which could adversely affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The merger agreement prohibits us from affirmatively seeking other acquisition proposals that may be superior to the merger.
The merger agreement prohibits us from engaging in any further discussions or solicitations regarding an alternative potential acquisition of the Company. This provision prevents us from affirmatively seeking offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending merger. Further, under the terms of the merger agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $50.0 million under specified conditions, including in the event Parent terminates the merger agreement for specified reasons and, within 12 months thereafter, we have consummated an acquisition proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, or entered into a definitive agreement regarding an acquisition proposal that is ultimately consummated. If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where the termination fee is potentially payable by the Company, this payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us, and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal following the termination of the merger agreement.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
The trading price of our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile and could decline substantially.
The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in significant fluctuations in price, regardless of our actual operating performance, include:
•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;
•changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•changes in the markets in which we operate;
•additions or departures of key personnel;
•actions by stockholders, including the sale by Lone Star of any of its shares of our common stock;
•speculation in the press or investment community;
•general market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown;
•uncertainty regarding economic events, including in Europe in connection with the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union;
•changes in interest rates;
•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•our ability to accurately project future results and our ability to achieve those and other industry and analyst forecasts; and
•new legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us, our markets or our industry.
Furthermore, at times, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry, and often occurs without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Therefore, factors that have little or nothing to do with us could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, and these fluctuations or any fluctuations related to our company could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially.
The coverage of our business or our common stock by securities or industry analysts or the absence thereof could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. We currently have, but may not be able to continue, research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If analysts do not continue coverage of us, the trading price and volume of our stock would likely be negatively impacted. Even if analyst coverage continues, if we fail to meet analyst expectations or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or inaccurate research, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Lone Star may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders and may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.
Lone Star beneficially owns approximately 52.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this concentration of stock ownership, Lone Star acting on its own has sufficient voting power to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including director elections and proposed amendments to our bylaws or certificate of incorporation. Five of the nine members of our board of directors are employees or affiliates of Lone Star.
In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a merger, consolidation or other business combination or change in control of our company and make some transactions that might otherwise give investors the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock more difficult or impossible without the support of Lone Star. Because we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, regulating certain business combinations with interested stockholders, Lone Star may transfer control of us to a third party by transferring its common stock without the approval of our board of directors or other stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The interests of Lone Star may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the
interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, Lone Star could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which investors would not approve or make decisions with which investors would disagree. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our share price.
Lone Star is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, although it does not currently hold any such interests. Lone Star may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In recognition that principals, members, directors, managers, partners, stockholders, officers, employees and other representatives of Lone Star and its affiliates and investment funds may serve as our directors or officers, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that none of Lone Star or any principal, member, director, manager, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other representative of Lone Star has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do. In the event that any of these persons or entities acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us, we will not have any expectancy in such corporate opportunity, and these persons and entities will not have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves or direct such opportunity to another person. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if, among other things, attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Lone Star to themselves or their other affiliates.
Lone Star may also have conflicts of interest with the Company and other stockholders as a result of its status as a party to the tax receivable agreement. For example, the tax receivable agreement entered into with Lone Star at the time of our initial public offering gives us the right to terminate the tax receivable agreement with approval of a majority of our independent directors and with Lone Star’s consent by making a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the tax receivable agreement (based on certain assumptions and deemed events in the agreement, including those relating to our and our subsidiaries’ future taxable income). Lone Star may determine to withhold its consent to terminate the tax receivable agreement at a time when such a termination would be favorable to us and the other stockholders. Furthermore, the tax receivable agreement prohibits us from settling any tax audit without Lone Star’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the outcome of the audit is reasonably expected to affect Lone Star’s rights under the tax receivable agreement. Therefore, Lone Star may determine to withhold consent to a settlement that reduces the payments Lone Star will receive under the tax receivable agreement, even though the settlement might be favorable to us and our stockholders.
We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
Lone Star controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under the relevant Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a person or group is a “controlled company” and need not comply with certain requirements, including the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors and the requirements that the compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be composed entirely of independent directors. We are utilizing these exemptions and, for so long as Lone Star controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we intend to continue to utilize these exemptions. As a result, among other things, we do not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, investors will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.
Lone Star beneficially owns approximately 52.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. The shares held by Lone Star and all shares held by our affiliates are eligible for resale in the public market, subject to applicable securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. In December
2019 we registered the shares of common stock beneficially owned by Lone Star pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement and these shares are now generally freely tradeable in the public market, subject to applicable securities laws. Unless the shares owned by any of our other affiliates are registered under the Securities Act, these shares may only be resold into the public markets in accordance with the requirements of an exemption from registration or safe harbor, including Rule 144 and the volume limitations, manner of sale requirements and notice requirements thereof. Any sale by Lone Star or other affiliates or any perception in the public markets that such a transaction may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially.
We have issued, and in the future we expect to issue, options, restricted stock and other forms of stock-based compensation, which have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause the price of our common stock to decline.
We have issued, and in the future expect to issue, stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock and other forms of stock-based compensation to our independent directors, officers and employees. If any options that we have issued or may issue are exercised, or any restricted stock or other awards that we have issued or may issue vests, and the shares of common stock are sold into the public market, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, the availability of shares of common stock for award under our equity incentive plan, or the grant of stock options, restricted stock or other forms of stock-based compensation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock.
We have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, projections, liquidity, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our credit facility and agreements governing any other indebtedness we may enter into and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may need to sell their shares to realize a return on their investment and may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid.
Provisions of our amended and restated governing documents, Delaware law and other documents could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
•permit us to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of the series and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series;
•prevent stockholders from calling special meetings;
•restrict the ability of stockholders to act by written consent after such time as Lone Star owns less than a majority of our common stock;
•limit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals;
•do not permit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election; and
•establish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms (which will be phased out over the next 3 annual meetings of stockholders).
These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company, including a transaction in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes an exclusive forum clause, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware); in all cases subject to such court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. The exclusive forum clause may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding such exclusive forum clause, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.
Risks Related to Our Tax Receivable Agreement
We will be required to pay Lone Star for certain tax benefits, and these amounts are expected to be material.
We entered into a tax receivable agreement with Lone Star that provides for the payment by us to Lone Star of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax that we and our subsidiaries realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of the utilization of certain tax benefits, together with interest accrued at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points from the date the applicable tax return is due (without extension) until paid. These tax benefits, which we collectively refer to as the Covered Tax Benefits, include: (i) all depreciation and amortization deductions, and any offset to taxable income and gain or increase to taxable loss, resulting from the tax basis that we have in our assets as of the time of the consummation of our initial public offering, (ii) the utilization of our and our subsidiaries’ net operating losses and tax credits, if any, attributable to periods prior to our initial public offering, (iii) deductions in respect of payments made, funded or reimbursed by an initial party to the tax receivable agreement (other than us or one of our subsidiaries) or an affiliate thereof to participants under the LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd Long Term Incentive Plan, or the LTIP, (iv) deductions in respect of transaction expenses attributable to the acquisition of U.S. Pipe and (v) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement will remain in effect until all Covered Tax Benefits have been used or expired, unless the agreement is terminated early, as described below.
We expect that the payments we make under the tax receivable agreement could be substantial. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we paid $13.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, on our tax receivable agreement to Lone Star. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we and our subsidiaries earn sufficient income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the tax receivable agreement, we currently estimate that future payments under the agreement will aggregate to approximately $64.2 million. This amount excludes any payments that may be made to Lone Star under the tax receivable agreement as a result of tax benefits recognized in connection with payments under the LTIP and, thus, the actual payments we ultimately are required to make under the tax receivable agreement could be greater, potentially materially greater, than these amounts. These payment obligations are our obligations and are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries. Furthermore, these payment obligations are not conditioned upon Lone Star maintaining a continued direct or indirect ownership interest in us. The actual utilization of Covered Tax Benefits as well as the timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our subsidiaries’ taxable income in the future.
We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Lone Star under the tax receivable agreement in the event that the tax benefits are disallowed.
Lone Star will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such benefits are subsequently disallowed upon a successful challenge by the Internal Revenue Service, although future payments under the agreement would be adjusted to the extent possible to reflect the result of such disallowance. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings if any, from the Covered Tax Benefits, and we may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.
In certain cases, payments made by us under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits.
The term of the tax receivable agreement will continue until all Covered Tax Benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the agreement with Lone Star’s consent, we breach any of our material obligations under the agreement or certain credit events occur with respect to us, in any of which cases we will be required to make an accelerated payment to Lone Star equal to the present value of future payments under the tax receivable agreement. Such payment would be based on certain assumptions, including, among others, that we and our subsidiaries would generate sufficient taxable income and tax liability to fully utilize all Covered Tax Benefits. The tax receivable agreement also provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, our (or our successor’s) payments under the tax receivable agreement for each taxable year after any such event would be based on certain valuation assumptions, including the assumption that we and our subsidiaries have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the Covered Tax Benefits. Accordingly, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits.
Even if the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not accelerated as described above, such payments may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits, due to the manner in which payments are calculated under the tax receivable agreement. For example, for purposes of calculating the payments to be made to Lone Star:
•it is assumed that we will pay effective state and local taxes at a rate of 5%, even though our actual effective state and local tax rate may be materially lower;
•tax benefits existing at the time of our initial public offering are deemed to be utilized before any post-closing/after-acquired tax benefits and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star for a particular tax year even if our tax liability for such year would have been materially reduced or eliminated by reason of our utilization of the post-initial public offering/after-acquired tax benefits;
•a non-taxable transfer of assets by us to a non-consolidated entity is treated under the tax receivable agreement as a taxable sale at fair market value and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star even though such non-taxable transfer would not generate any actual tax benefits to us or our non-consolidated entity; and
•a taxable sale or other taxable transfer of subsidiary stock by us (in cases where the subsidiary’s tax basis in its assets exceeds our tax basis in the subsidiary’s stock) is treated under the tax receivable agreement as a taxable sale of the subsidiary’s assets and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star that materially exceed the actual tax benefit we realize from such stock sale.
Because of the foregoing, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.
Certain provisions of the tax receivable agreement limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and growth strategy.
For so long as the tax receivable agreement remains outstanding, without the prior written consent of Lone Star (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), we will be prohibited from (a) entering into any agreement that would be materially more restrictive with respect to our ability to make payments under the tax receivable agreement than the terms of our credit agreement and (b) incurring any indebtedness for borrowed money if, immediately after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of proceeds therefrom, our consolidated net leverage ratio - the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness for borrowed money less unrestricted cash to consolidated EBITDA - would exceed a certain specified ratio, in each case as calculated pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, unless the incurrence of such indebtedness is permitted by the terms of our credit agreement or any replacement credit agreements to the extent the terms thereof are no less restrictive in this regard than the applicable credit agreement it replaced. These restrictions on the incurrence of debt could adversely affect our business, including by preventing us from pursuing an acquisition or other strategic transaction that we believe is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders, thereby impeding our growth strategy. Lone Star has no fiduciary duties to us when deciding whether to enforce these covenants under the tax receivable agreement. Furthermore, the provision in the tax receivable agreement that requires that we make an accelerated payment to Lone Star equal to the present value of all future payments due under the tax receivable agreement if we breach any of our material obligations under the agreement or certain credit events occur with respect to us might make it harder for us to obtain financing from third party lenders on favorable terms.
We would be required to make tax gross-up payments to Lone Star if we consummate a corporate inversion or similar transaction that causes payments under the tax receivable agreement to be subject to withholding taxes.
If we were to consummate a change of control transaction that causes us (or our successor) to become a non-U.S. person (e.g., a corporate inversion transaction), and such transaction causes payments under the tax receivable agreement to become subject to withholding taxes, we would be required under the tax receivable agreement to make tax gross-up payments to Lone Star in respect of such withholding taxes in amounts that may exceed the tax savings realized by the Company from the Covered Tax Benefits. Any such tax gross-up payments could have a negative impact on our liquidity and our ability to finance our growth.

Item 3.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We have been from time to time, and may in the future become, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be part of the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, and the discussion therein under the headings “Earnout Dispute” and “Derivative Action” is incorporated herein by reference.
Earnout Dispute
On March 13, 2015, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Lone Star acquired the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG, or Heidelberg, in the United States and Eastern Canada, or the Acquisition. The Acquisition purchase agreement included an earnout, which provided for the payment of contingent consideration of up to $100.0 million, if and to the extent the 2015 financial results of the businesses acquired by Lone Star in the Acquisition, including the Company and Heidelberg's former building products business in the United Kingdom, exceeded a specified Adjusted EBITDA target for fiscal year 2015, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. If such Adjusted EBITDA calculation exceeded the specified target, LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd., or LSF9, and, as a result of the internal reorganization transaction effected prior to the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, the Company would be required to pay the U.S. affiliate of Heidelberg an amount equal to a multiple of such excess Adjusted EBITDA, with any payment capped at $100.0 million. In April 2016, the Company provided an earnout statement to affiliates of Heidelberg demonstrating that no payment was required. On June 13, 2016, Heidelberg provided notification that it disputed, among other things, the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the purchase agreement and asserting that a payment should be made in the amount of $100.0 million. On October 5, 2016, affiliates of Heidelberg filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking specific performance and claiming access to the Company's books, records, and personnel; seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the scope of the neutral accounting expert’s authority; and in the alternative, claiming a breach of contract and seeking the $100.0 million and other damages (the ""Delaware Action""). On December 8, 2017, the court granted the defendants' Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint in the Delaware Action, finding that the earnout dispute should be heard before a neutral accounting arbitrator as set forth in the purchase agreement and that any claims that were required to be brought as indemnification claims under the purchase agreement were time-barred by the contractual limitations period. Following the dismissal of the Delaware Action, the Company and Heidelberg jointly engaged a neutral
accounting expert to act as an arbitrator in the dispute as required by the purchase agreement. After briefing certain preliminary matters for the arbitrator and the production of additional documents, the parties began briefing the issues on the merits for the neutral accounting arbitrator, which was completed in April 2020. A hearing on the dispute was held in June 2020, and a written decision was issued by the neutral accounting arbitrator on September 10, 2020 in which the arbitrator ruled that no earnout payment was owed in the matter. The deadline for Heidelberg to take any action to overturn the ruling was in December 2020, and they took no action, so we believe the ruling is final. As of December 31, 2020, no liability for this contingency has been accrued as payment of any earnout is not considered probable. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
Shareholder Derivative Action
On January 15, 2019, a putative shareholder derivative complaint captioned Lee v. Bradley, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, naming as defendants certain of our current and former directors and officers (the ""Lee Action""). The complaint alleges the defendants violated Section 14A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related rules by failing to make certain disclosures in our proxy solicitation in advance of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and that defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and committed constructive fraud. The complaint also asserts unjust enrichment claims against certain defendants. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the Company, unspecified damages, an order directing the return of certain payments to the defendants, certain injunctive relief, and reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. After initially staying the case until the court in a prior, unrelated shareholder class action that has now been settled ruled on the motion to dismiss in that case, on December 11, 2019, the court in the Lee Action entered a Stipulation and Order consolidating the Lee Action and another derivative action filed in the same court into a single case (the ""Consolidated Lee Action""), and providing a schedule for filing of an amended complaint and motions to dismiss, which has been further extended by agreement of the parties. A mediation of the dispute was held on June 12, 2020 but was not successful in resolving the dispute. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2020 and Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in September 2020, which is now fully briefed and before the court and a decision is expected in the coming months.
We and other defendants are vigorously defending the Consolidated Lee Action. Given the stage of the proceedings, we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may arise from the Consolidated Lee Action. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
North Birmingham EPA Matter
U.S. Pipe received a General Notice Letter and Invitation to Conduct Removal Action dated September 20, 2013 from the EPA with respect to the 35th Avenue superfund site in Birmingham, Alabama. The letter requests that U.S. Pipe participate in an environmental response action in an area proximate to a closed U.S. Pipe facility in North Birmingham, Alabama. The U.S. Pipe North Birmingham facility was closed and, as part of the acquisition of U.S. Pipe by a private equity fund from Mueller Water Products, Inc. and Mueller Group, LLC, or the Sellers, in 2012, the facility was retained by and is currently owned by either the Sellers or one of their affiliates. The notice requested response activities including testing and removing surface soils at area residences alleged to be contaminated by locally-sourced air pollutants. In connection with the disposition, the Sellers agreed to jointly and severally defend and indemnify U.S. Pipe against any losses or environmental liabilities related to sites retained by the Sellers, including the North Birmingham facility. Accordingly, U.S. Pipe tendered the defense of this matter to the Sellers for defense and indemnification. The Sellers accepted the tender and, on behalf of U.S. Pipe, have responded to the EPA’s request to participate in a time-critical removal action by declining, based on the EPA’s failure to establish any nexus between the contamination and any operations at the U.S. Pipe North Birmingham facility. The EPA sent a renewed request addressed to the Sellers, U.S. Pipe and a number of other potentially responsible parties on August 8, 2014 seeking participation in a broader cleanup of soil at approximately 80 homes in North Birmingham. The Sellers again responded on U.S. Pipe’s behalf declining to participate on the same grounds. In September 2014, the EPA proposed that the site be listed on the National Priorities List. The Sellers continue to defend on this matter on behalf of U.S. Pipe. While we cannot provide assurance that such defense will be successful, because of the indemnification described above, we do not
believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Overview
Our Company
We are a manufacturer of ductile iron pipe and concrete pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada for a variety of essential water-related infrastructure applications, including water transmission, distribution and drainage. Our manufacturing and distribution network allows us to serve most major U.S. and Eastern Canadian markets. We operate 77 active manufacturing facilities and currently have additional manufacturing capacity available in both of our segments, providing room to increase production to meet short-cycle demand with minimal incremental investment. These facilities and our distribution network provide us with a local presence and the necessary proximity to our customers to minimize delivery time and distribution costs to the markets we serve.
Quikrete Merger Agreement
On February 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Quikrete Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Parent, and Jordan Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, or the Merger, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, or the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of ours (other than (i) any shares held in the treasury of us or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of us immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) shares that are subject to any vesting restrictions, or the Company Restricted Shares, granted under our stock incentive plans, or the Company Stock Plans, and (iii) any shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $24.00 in cash, without interest, or Merger Consideration, subject to deductions for any required withholding tax.
At the Effective Time:
(1)each restricted stock unit that is solely subject to time-based vesting requirements granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such vested restricted stock unit;
(2)each restricted stock unit that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such vested restricted stock unit immediately prior to the Effective Time as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
(3)each option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest, to the extent not vested previously, and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the remainder, if positive, of (A) the Merger Consideration minus (B) the exercise price per share of Common Stock of such option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such vested option; and
(4)each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest in full and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the Merger Consideration.
Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (i) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) the absence of any order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; (iii) the passing of twenty (20) days from the date on which we mail to our stockholders the Information Statement (as defined below) in definitive form; (iv) subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (v) the performance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on, among other things, the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Entry into the Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our board of directors.
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of us, Parent and Merger Sub. Among other things, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its businesses until the Merger is consummated. We and Parent have also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any approvals from governmental authorities for the Merger, including all required antitrust approvals, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, provided that Parent and its affiliates will not be required to take, or agree to take, certain actions with respect to assets, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or we or any of its subsidiaries, accounting for more than $80 million of EBITDA (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, measured in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains certain provisions giving each of Parent and us rights to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including the right for either Parent or us to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated on or before November 19, 2021, which date will be automatically extended for up to two additional 60-day periods in specified circumstances as described in the Merger Agreement, or the Outside Date. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $50 million. The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of $85 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of the parties to obtain required approvals under Antitrust Laws (as defined in the Merger Agreement) prior to the Outside Date or as a result of a Restraint (as defined in the Merger Agreement) arising under applicable Antitrust Laws.
If the Merger is consummated, the shares of Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Our Segments
Our operations are organized into the following reportable segments:
•Drainage Pipe & Products - We are a producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products and concrete pressure pipe products.
•Water Pipe & Products - We are a producer of ductile iron pipe, or DIP.
•Corporate and Other - Corporate, general and administrative expenses not allocated to our revenue-generating segments such as certain shared services, executive and other administrative functions.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified our pressure pipe business from Water segment to Drainage segment to better align with our organizational structure.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in mid-March, local, state, provincial and federal authorities began issuing stay at home orders in response to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, which has quickly spread throughout the United States and worldwide. These government-instituted restrictions, together with the economic volatility and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, have had a significant impact on the United States economy in general and certain parts of our end-markets in particular. Despite these events and the related uncertainty, we have continued to operate as an essential business under the government orders, and the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially affected our liquidity, financial results or business operations thus far. During the initial phase of the pandemic in the early part of the second quarter, we experienced temporary delays in certain projects, primarily related to governmental stay-at-home orders in place at that time and the reactions of certain customers to those orders, specifically in our residential end-markets. Late in the second quarter and continuing through 2020 and into 2021, as most states started gradually resuming their normal economic activities, there was some correction in these trends in the residential housing market.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on protecting the health and safety of our team members while maintaining our operations, which have been deemed essential under relevant pandemic-related government regulations, and continuing to meet our customers’ needs. Although some of our team members have tested positive for COVID-19, and we encountered temporary closures of a small number of our manufacturing facilities in the second quarter due to such cases or due to government mandate, these events have not had a significant impact on our operations or our ability to serve our customers' needs. We are however utilizing the option under the CARES Act to defer the employer portion of the social security taxes that would otherwise be due in 2020, but will be delayed with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022.
However, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pandemic and related economic impacts may affect our operations in 2021, in particular due to the uncertainty of future funding and demand in our infrastructure and municipal end-markets, as well as increased case numbers in locations where we have large numbers of employees or significant customer concentration. Our backlogs are stronger to date in 2021 than they were in 2020, however, and bidding activity also appears strong.
Due to the fluidity and unprecedented and uncertain nature of the pandemic, we cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or that of our customers, and participants in our supply chain, or on economic conditions generally, including the effects on infrastructure and other construction activity. The ultimate scope and extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time even after the pandemic may end.
For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Our financial performance and results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including conditions in the residential, non-residential and infrastructure construction markets, general economic conditions, changes in cost of goods sold, competitive behavior in the markets we serve, and seasonality and weather conditions. Some of the more important factors are discussed below, as well as in the section Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” with the exception of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which are discussed above.
Infrastructure Spending and Residential and Non-Residential Construction Activities
A large proportion of our net sales in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment is generated through public infrastructure projects, which are driven by federal, state and provincial funding programs. In the U.S., federal funds are allocated to the states, which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline and other user fees. The dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs. Funding for the existing U.S. federal transportation funding program extends through 2021. With the nation’s infrastructure aging, there is increased demand by states and municipalities for long-term federal funding to support the construction of new roads, highways and bridges in addition to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure. In addition to federal funding, state, county and local agencies provide highway construction and maintenance funding through various sources such as gas taxes.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high levels of unemployment and a slowdown in economic activities, mostly brought on by stay-at-home orders or partial shutdowns issued during 2020 by various state, county, city and local authorities across the country. The state and local transportation programs that depend on sales tax and gas tax revenues are also facing funding shortfalls. Many states have delayed projects or cut capital programs in 2020. The American Road and Transportation Builders Association (“ARTBA”) forecasts transportation construction activity to decline 5.5 percent in 2021, and to resume growth in 2022 as economic conditions improve to pre-COVID levels.
A large proportion of our net sales in our Water Pipe & Products segment is generated through municipal infrastructure projects. The U.S. potable water infrastructure, especially the underground pipes that deliver drinking water to homes and businesses, is aging and in need of significant reinvestment. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the U.S. relies, most of the underground drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. In some older urban areas, many water mains have been in the ground for a century or longer. Given its age, a large proportion of the U.S. water infrastructure is approaching, or has already reached, the end of its useful life. In some locations, improvements to water infrastructure are needed to comply with standards for drinking water quality. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates 240,000 water main breaks per year in the U.S. due to aging pipelines, wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water. The underlying demand for municipalities to repair or replace their water systems depends on the status of the water systems and the availability of funding. With people spending more time at their homes in order to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, it is even more critical to ensure the uninterrupted supply of clean water.
A relatively smaller proportion of our products has been closely tied to residential construction and non-residential construction activity in the United States and Eastern Canada. Activity levels in these markets can be materially affected by general economic and global financial market conditions. In addition, residential construction activity levels are influenced by and sensitive to mortgage availability, the cost of financing a home (in particular, mortgage and interest rates), unemployment levels, household formation rates, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, existing housing prices, rental prices, housing inventory levels, consumer confidence and government policy and incentives. During 2020, we saw a brief downturn in the housing market at the onset of
the pandemic, but it quickly rebounded and continued to grow throughout the remainder of 2020, driven by improvements in economic activities, increased demand for single-family housing as more people work remotely, as well as historically low mortgage interest rates. Non-residential construction activity is primarily driven by levels of business investment, availability of credit and interest rates, as well as many of the factors that impact residential construction activity levels. See Item 1 “Business.”
Mix of Products
We derive our revenues from both the sale of products manufactured to inventory, such as concrete drainage pipe and DIP, and highly engineered products which are made to order, such as precast concrete products and concrete pressure pipe. These two product categories differ in their dynamics. The mix of products our customers order is project driven and varies from period to period. We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment of our products; however, for some of our highly engineered structural precast products, we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method, which accounted for 2.6% of our total sales in 2020.
Most of our products are sold on a one-off basis, with volumes and prices determined frequently based on market participants’ perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry, or in the regions where we have operations, or the behavior of our competitors, can each result in significant increases or decreases in market prices for these products, often within a short period of time. By contrast, our project-driven business involves highly engineered and customized products with a wide range of contract values. The products for these projects are engineered, manufactured and delivered on the basis of contracts that tend to extend over periods of several months or, in some cases, several years. The timing of the commencement of a project and the progress and completion of work under a contract, therefore, can have a significant effect on our results of operations for a particular period.
Average Selling Prices
The average selling prices we are able to obtain for our products affect our results of operations and our margins. Our average selling price can vary by market location, particularly in our Drainage Pipe and Products segment, product mix, factors relating to supply and demand, and the actions of our customers and competitors. The average selling prices for our products increased in 2020 over the average selling prices we received in 2019 in both our Water and Drainage segments.
Cost of Goods Sold
Costs of raw material and other inputs, supplies, labor (including contract labor), freight and energy constitute a large portion of our cost of goods sold, and fluctuations in the prices of these materials and inputs affect our results of operations and, in particular, our margins. Our primary raw materials in our Drainage Pipe and Products segment are cement, aggregates, and steel. We typically negotiate contracts with suppliers of these materials for one to three years, with prices subject to annual revisions. The primary input in our Water business is scrap steel, which we purchase on the spot market, and its costs can vary significantly from period to period. We do not generally hedge our raw material purchases but rather utilize our product pricing strategy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in our raw material costs.
Seasonality and Weather Conditions
The construction industry, and therefore demand for our products, is typically seasonal and highly dependent on weather conditions, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. Because the majority of our products are buried underground, we experience lower demand for our products in periods of cold weather, particularly during winter, and periods of excessive rain or flooding. These types of conditions or other unfavorable weather conditions generally lead to seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. Historically, our net sales in the second and third quarters have been higher than in the other quarters of the year, particularly the first quarter.
In addition, unfavorable weather conditions, such as hurricanes or severe storms, or public holidays during peak construction periods can result in temporary cessation of projects and a material reduction in demand for our products and consequently have an adverse effect on our net sales. Results of a fiscal quarter may therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in the other fiscal quarters in the same year or prior years.
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is focused on continued execution of our five improvement pillars: health and safety of our team members, plant-level operational discipline, enhanced commercial capabilities, working capital efficiency, and general and administrative effectiveness. See Item 1 ""Business"" These pillars are designed to expand our product margin so that we can earn a full and fair return on the products we produce and the capital we deploy. We are also committed to strengthen our capital structure through a combination of working capital improvement, debt repayment and prudent investment in the business. Prudent investment in the business includes growth capital expenditures in projects and smaller acquisitions. Our near-term goal is to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3x-3.5x. After achieving that, we will cautiously evaluate our capital allocation plans going forward to maximize values to our stakeholders.
Principal Components of Results of Operations
Net Sales
Net sales consist of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of products in the ordinary course of business and include the billable costs of delivery of our products to customers, net of discounts given to the customer. Net sales include any outbound freight charged to the customer. Revenue on certain long-term engineering and construction contracts for our structural precast and products that are designed and engineered specifically for the customer is recognized under the percentage-of completion method. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Total Company
The following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands).
* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%
Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,594.5 million, an increase of $64.7 million or 4.2% from $1,529.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was the net effect of a $90.3 million increase in our in our Water Pipe & Products segment mostly due to higher average selling prices; partially offset by a decrease of $25.6 million in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,217.8 million, a decrease of $15.6 million or 1.3% from $1,233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The small decrease in cost of goods sold was the net effect of a $36.2 million decrease in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by an increase of $20.8 million in our Water Pipe & Products segment primarily due to a slight year-over-year increase in shipment volumes while unit cost of sales remained relatively flat.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $376.7 million, an increase of $80.3 million, or 27.1%, from $296.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit in both our Water Pipe & Products segment and our Drainage Pipe & Products segment increased by $69.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively, primarily due to higher average selling prices in both businesses, partially offset by the volume decline in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $221.8 million, the same as $221.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Higher incentive compensation expenses of $6.1 million driven by better results were partially offset by lower travel expenses of $3.1 million, and lower executive severance expenses of $2.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019.
Impairment and Exit Charges
Impairment and exit charges in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.5 million, compared to $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges in both years primarily related to plant closings undertaken for purposes of achieving operating efficiencies.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $79.9 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 15.9%, from $95.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by both the impact of lower LIBOR of $12.3 million and the impact of lower average outstanding debt balance of $4.0 million as we continued voluntarily prepaying our term loan, partially offset by $6.3 million impact of higher interest rate on the $500 million senior secured notes that were issued in July 2020. In addition, $5.4 million of the change was related to the decrease of mark-to-market loss on the interest rate swaps year over year.
Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.3 million, compared to a gain of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss in 2020 was primarily driven by the write-off of the deferred debt issuance cost of $13.1 million associated with our $612.5 million term loan prepayment at par with the proceeds from the offering of our Senior Notes and cash on hand, slightly offset by a gain from our $83.5
million open-market term loan repurchases at small discounts. The gain in 2019 primarily related to our open-market purchases of term loan at discounts.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit
Income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.5 million, a change of $11.8 million from an income tax benefit of $3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is primarily due to the improvement of our operating income in 2020 to $72.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2019. The increase in income tax expense was partially offset by an $11.8 million reversal of valuation allowance in 2020 as our operating income continues to improve.
Segment Results of Operations
(1) For purposes of evaluating segment performance, the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as a basis for making the decisions to allocate resources and assess performance. Our discussion below includes the primary drivers of EBITDA. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, for segment EBITDA reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes.
(2) During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified the pressure pipe business from Water segment to Drainage segment to better align with our organizational structure. The US and Canadian Pressure Pipe businesses were formerly managed by the Water segment management team, however Forterra changed its internal management structure to include the remaining Canadian Pressure Pipe plant under the same management team that oversees the Canadian Pipe & Precast operations. As a result, historical segment data were restated to reflect the current segment compositions.
Drainage Pipe & Products
Net Sales
Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $887.4 million, a decrease of $25.6 million, or 2.8%, from $913.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the net effect of a $91.3 million decrease due to lower shipment volumes in our pipe and precast products driven by less favorable weather in 2020 compared to 2019, temporary project delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our margin-enhancing ""value before volume"" commercial strategy; partially offset by a $53.7 million increase driven by
higher average selling price in our pipe and precast products. Pipe and precast products revenues accounted for more than 85% of the net sales in this segment. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily related to our structural precast business and was driven by higher shipment volumes.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $211.6 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 5.3% from $201.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower shipment volumes of our pipe and precast products.
Water Pipe & Products
Net Sales
Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $707.1 million, an increase of $90.4 million or 14.7% from $616.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the combination of $76.2 million driven by higher average selling prices and $13.9 million driven by higher shipment volumes of our ductile iron pipe products. Ductile-iron pipe sales accounted for more than 85% of the net sales in this segment.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $165.1 million, an increase of $69.5 million or 72.7% from $95.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to both higher average selling prices and higher shipment volumes.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Total Company
The following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands).
* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%
Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1,529.8 million, an increase of $50.1 million or 3.4% from $1,479.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was the net effect of a $73.3 million increase in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment primarily due to higher average selling prices and higher shipment volumes; partially offset by a $23.3 million decrease in our Water Pipe & Products segment primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1,233.4 million, a decrease of $0.7 million or 0.1% from $1,234.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The small change in cost of goods sold was the net effect of a $50.1 million decrease in our Water Pipe & Products segment primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower cost of scrap metal, offset by a $49.7 million increase in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment primarily driven by higher shipment volumes.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $296.4 million, an increase of $50.8 million, or 20.7%, from $245.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit in our Drainage Pipe & Products segment increased by $23.6 million primarily due to higher average selling prices and higher shipment volumes; gross profit in our Water Pipe & Products segment also increased by $26.8 million, primarily driven by higher average selling prices as well as lower scrap metal raw material costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2019 were $221.8 million, an increase of $11.9 million or 5.7% from $209.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher IT costs as we invest in our systems and processes, increased expenses related to various disputes and claims in the ordinary course of our business, increased reserves for credit losses, as well as a $3.7 million executive severance charge primarily related to the change in CEO in 2019.
Impairment and Exit Charges
Impairment and exit charges in the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.5 million, compared to $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The exit charges in both years primarily related to plant closings undertaken for purposes of achieving operating efficiencies.
Other Operating Income
Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.1 million, compared to $9.5 million in the prior year period. The income in the 2018 period primarily related to gains from the disposition of certain property, plant and equipment.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.0 million, an increase of $16.7 million, or 21.2%, from $78.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The interest expense in 2019 included $7.8 million resulting from the change in the classification of certain leases from operating lease to finance lease as the result of the amendment and restatement of our sale-leaseback transaction completed in June 2018. In addition, $7.8 million of the change related to the increase in interest expense due to the mark-to-market on the interest rate swaps year over year. The remainder of the interest expense increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average interest rates.
Other Income, net
Other income, net of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the gain from a divestiture transaction that was completed in February 2018.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit
Income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.3 million, a change of $6.4 million from an income tax expense of $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is primarily due to the benefit of the favorable valuation allowance movement between the two years of $8.4 million, and was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in tax expense primarily related to greater pre-tax earnings in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.

As a result, historical segment data were restated to reflect the current segment compositions.
Drainage Pipe & Products
Net Sales
Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $913.0 million, an increase of $73.3 million, or 8.7%, from $839.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the combination of $52.5 million due to higher average selling prices and $23.0 million due to higher shipment volumes of our pipe and precast products. Pipe and precast products revenues accounted for more than 85% of the net sales in this segment.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $201.0 million, an increase of $23.6 million or 13.3%, from $177.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices and higher shipment volumes of our pipe and precast products, slightly offset by higher cost of raw materials.
Water Pipe & Products
Net Sales
Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 were $616.7 million, a decrease of $23.3 million or 3.6% from $640.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was the net effect of a $44.9 million decrease caused by lower shipment volumes of our ductile-iron pipe products, partially offset by a $23.6 million increase contributed by higher average selling price of our ductile-iron pipe products. Ductile-iron pipe sales accounted for more than 85% of the net sales in this segment.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.6 million, an increase of $26.8 million or 38.9% from $68.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher average selling prices as well as lower raw material costs related to our ductile-iron pipe products.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our available cash and cash equivalents, borrowing availability under our $350.0 million Revolver, and funds generated from operations are our most significant sources of liquidity. While we believe these sources will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures that are essential, debt service obligations and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, our future liquidity will depend in part upon our operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately $25.7 million and $34.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, of which $12.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively, were held by foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were readily convertible as of such dates into currencies used in the Company’s operations, including the U.S. dollar. As a result of the TCJA, we can repatriate the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal additional taxes other than state income and foreign withholding tax.
In connection with the IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with Lone Star that provides for the payment by us to Lone Star of specified amounts in respect of any cash savings as a result of the utilization of certain tax benefits. The actual utilization of the relevant tax benefits as well as the timing of any payments under
the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our subsidiaries’ taxable income in the future. However, we expect that the payments we make under the tax receivable agreement could be substantial. The tax receivable agreement also includes provisions that restrict the incurrence of debt and require that we make an accelerated payment to Lone Star equal to the present value of all future payments due under the tax receivable agreement, in each case under certain circumstances. Because of the foregoing, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. The passage of the TCJA significantly reduced the Company's anticipated liability under the tax receivable agreement. Our liability recorded for the tax receivable agreement at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $64.2 million and $77.4 million, respectively, with $8.3 million and $13.1 million, respectively, being classified as short-term. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we paid $13.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, to Lone Star under the tax receivable agreement.
Our forecast for payments under the tax receivable agreement in 2021 is expected to be in the range of $8 to $10 million. We expect that future annual payments under the tax receivable agreement will decline each year in accordance with our tax basis depreciation and amortization schedule unless future transactions result in an acceleration of our tax benefits under the agreement. See Item 1A, Risk Factors and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Credit Agreements
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we voluntarily prepaid $203.5 million of our Term Loan prepaid $492.5 million of our Term Loan using the net proceeds from the offering of the senior secured notes, as further described below. As of December 31, 2020, we had $414.9 million outstanding balance under our Term Loan. At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under our Revolver and our available borrowing capacity under the Revolver was $235.6 million.
The Revolver provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million, with up to $330.0 million to be made available to the U.S. borrowers and up to $20.0 million to be made available to the Canadian borrowers. Subject to the conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement, the Revolver may be increased by up to the greater of (i) $100.0 million and (ii) such amount as would not cause the aggregate borrowing base to be exceeded by more than $50.0 million. Borrowings under the Revolver may not exceed a borrowing base equal to the sum of (i) 100% of eligible cash, (ii) 85% of eligible accounts receivable and (iii) the lesser of (a) 75% of eligible inventory and (b) 85% of the orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, with the U.S. and Canadian borrowings being subject to separate borrowing base limitations. The Revolver bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR or CDOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, or an alternate base rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% per annum, in each case, based upon the average excess availability under the Revolver for the most recently completed calendar quarter and our total leverage ratio as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. The Revolver matures on June 17, 2025, subject to earlier maturity if greater than $75.0 million of our Term Loan remains outstanding 91 days prior to the scheduled maturity of the term loan credit facility or any refinancing thereof.
The Term Loan, as amended, provides for a $1.25 billion senior secured term loan. Subject to the conditions set forth in the term loan agreement, the Term Loan may be increased by (i) up to the greater of $285.0 million and 1.0x consolidated EBITDA of Forterra, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries for the four quarters most recently ended prior to such incurrence plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any voluntary prepayments, plus (iii) an additional amount, provided certain financial tests are met. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. The Term Loan matures on October 25, 2023 and is subject to quarterly amortization equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount. Interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings thereunder at a rate equal to LIBOR (with a floor of 1.0%) or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin of 3.00% or 2.00%, respectively. Our credit agreement does not provide a mechanism to facilitate the adoption of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of LIBOR. We plan to monitor the expected phase-out of LIBOR and may seek to renegotiate the benchmark rate with our lenders in the future. See Item 1A. ""Risk Factors.""
The Revolver and the Term Loan contain customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, engage in asset sales and pay dividends and make distributions. The Revolver contains a financial covenant restricting Forterra from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to drop below 1.00:1.00 during a compliance period, which is triggered when the availability under the Revolver falls below a threshold. The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization, less cash payments for capital expenditures and income taxes to consolidated fixed charges (interest expense plus scheduled payments of principal on indebtedness). The Term Loan does not contain any financial covenants. Obligations under the Revolver and the Term Loan may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate). As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Revolver and the Term Loan.
On July 16, 2020, two of our subsidiaries, Forterra Finance, LLC and FRTA Finance Corp., completed the issuance of $500 million senior secured notes, or the Notes, that are due July 15, 2025. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.50%. Obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by us and our existing and future subsidiaries (other than the issuers) that guarantee the Term Loan and the obligations of the U.S. borrowers under the Revolver. The Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the collateral that secures the Term Loan on a first-priority basis (which is generally all assets other than those that secure the Revolver on a first-priority basis as set forth below) and second-priority liens on the collateral that secures the Revolver on a first-priority basis (which is generally inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, certain intercompany loans and related assets), which second-priority liens is ratable with the liens on such assets securing the obligations under the Term Loan and junior to the liens on such assets securing the Revolver. Upon closing, we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $492.5 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan at par, plus accrued interest.

Summarized financial information for the two most recent annual periods was as follows (in thousands):
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands).
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Changes in operating cash flows between the periods are primarily due to the change in income from operations, timing of collections and payments, as well as the change in our inventory as compared to the prior year periods.
Operating cash flow increased to $243.2 million in 2020 as compared to $146.8 million in 2019 primarily due to higher income from operations and better working capital management. Operating cash flow increased to $146.8 million in 2019 as compared to $27.2 million in 2018 primarily due to higher income from operations and a decrease in ending inventory.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to capital expenditures of $34.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of $15.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to capital expenditures of $42.9 million and the acquisition of Buckner assets of $10.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of $11.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to capital expenditures of $48.7 million, final net working capital settlement related to U.S. Pressure Pipe Divestiture of $8.5 million, settlement on derivative contracts of $5.0 million, business acquisitions of $4.5 million and other asset acquisitions of $1.9 million, partially offset by cash received from the Foley Transaction of $9.1 million and proceeds from sale of fixed assets of $8.4 million.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $234.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to $707.6 million repayments of principal on the Term Loan, $13.1 million payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, and $11.4 million payment of debt issuance costs, partially offset by proceeds from senior secured notes of $500.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to $95.7 million of repayments of principal on the Term Loan and a $11.4 million payment pursuant to the tax receivable agreement. Net cash used in financing activities was $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to the payment of $30.4 million under our tax receivable agreement. The $30.4 million payment under the tax receivable agreement in 2018, pertaining to the 2017 tax year, included the impact of accelerated payments as a result of certain transactions completed in 2017, including the sale of the U.S. concrete and steel pressure pipe business, that caused an acceleration of tax benefits subject to the tax receivable agreement. The $11.4 million payment under the tax receivable agreement in 2019 was pertaining to the 2018 tax year.
Secondary Public Offering
On September 21, 2020, Forterra US Holdings, LLC (the “Selling Stockholder”), an affiliate of Lone Star, sold 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at $13.50 per share. The Selling Stockholder also granted the underwriters an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of our common stock. On October 13, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 200,000 shares of our common stock. As a result of the sale, the aggregate beneficial ownership of Lone Star decreased from 68.9% to 53.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of October 13, 2020, and we remain a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the Selling Stockholder.
Capital Expenditures
Under normal circumstances, our annual sustaining capital expenditures would average $45.0 million to $55.0 million. However, as a precautionary measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to preserve liquidity, we delayed some non-essential capital spending projects during the second quarter. During the third quarter, given the improvements in cash generation and liquidity, we resumed capital spending projects.
Our capital expenditures were $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect capital expenditures to be higher than usual in 2021 due to certain pandemic-delayed projects being completed in 2021. The majority of our planned capital spending now is related to equipment, such as plant and mobile equipment, upgrade and expansion of existing facilities, and environmental and permit compliance projects.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide surety bonds and standby letters of credit to secure performance commitments. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding stand-by letters of credit amounted to $16.7 million.
Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Non-cancelable operating leases are presented net of non-cancelable subleases. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimate and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table.
(1) The interest rate on the Term loan is 4.0%; the interest rate on the Notes is 6.5%.
Additionally, we have accrued approximately $55.9 million associated with the tax receivable agreement in long-term liabilities and $36.9 million of other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The risks and uncertainties associated with the tax receivable agreement are discussed above and in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combination transactions, as defined by ASC 805, Business Combination, are recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions. Initial purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of the transaction. The fair value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be based upon the discounted cash flow method that involves inputs that are not observable in the market (Level 3). Goodwill assigned represents the amount of consideration transferred in excess of the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Use of estimates
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the reporting date, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. The more significant estimates made relate to fair value estimates for assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations; accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup, bodily injury and insurance claims; estimates for commitments and contingencies; and estimates for the realizability of deferred tax assets, the tax receivable agreement obligation, inventory reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our inventories are valued using the average cost and first-in-first-out methods. Inventories include materials, labor and applicable factory overhead costs. The value of inventory is adjusted for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. Market value of inventory is estimated considering the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions, and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of each respective component of inventory.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net
Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which requires goodwill to be either qualitatively or quantitatively assessed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for each reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year and in interim periods if events occur that would indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. We first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. We may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow method (income approach) and the guideline company method (market approach). Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include future revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, EBITDA margins, future capital expenditures, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable; however, variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit including estimates for capital expenditures, discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted industry rate, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit. Cash flow projections are derived from one year budgeted amounts and five year operating forecasts plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur. Under the guideline company method, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using a three-year average. In addition, we estimate a reasonable control premium representing the incremental value that accrues to the majority owner from the opportunity to dictate the strategic and operational actions of the business.
Key assumptions for the measurement of an impairment include management’s estimate of future cash flows and EBITDA. The estimates of future cash flows and EBITDA are subjective in nature and are subject to impacts from the business risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Therefore, the actual results could differ significantly from the amounts used for goodwill impairment testing, and significant changes in fair value estimates could occur, resulting in potential impairments in future periods.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, no impairment charge was recorded for goodwill and intangible assets.
Leases Accounting Policy
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use, or ROU,
assets, accrued liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities, and long-term finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For machinery and equipment leases, such as forklifts, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Income Taxes
The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the asset/liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company uses the period cost method for Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, and therefore, has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction, including past operating results, future reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions only if it believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company evaluates whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold using the assumption that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based upon the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties, should they occur, are included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards associated with the transaction have been transferred to the purchaser, which is demonstrated when all the following conditions are met: evidence of a binding arrangement exists, products have been delivered or services have been rendered, there is no future performance required, fees are fixed or determinable and amounts are collectible under normal payment terms. Sales represent the net amounts charged or chargeable in respect of services rendered and goods supplied, excluding intercompany sales. Sales are recognized net of any discounts given to the customer.
A portion of our sales revenue is derived from sales to distributors. Distributor revenue is recognized when all of the criteria for revenue recognition are met, which is generally the time of shipment to the distributor. All returns and credits are estimable and recognized as contra-revenue.
We incur shipping costs to third parties for the transportation of building products and bill such costs to customers. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded freight costs of approximately $122.7 million, $131.8 million, and $127.0 million, respectively, on a gross basis within net sales and cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
For certain engineering and construction contracts and building contracting arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method, based on total contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated cost at completion for each contract. Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred. If estimated total costs on a contract indicate a loss, the entire loss is provided for in the financial statements immediately. To the extent we have invoiced and collected from customers more revenue than has been recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion method, we record the excess amount invoiced as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed, and balances billed but not yet paid by customers under retainage provisions are classified as a current asset within receivables, net on the balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, revenue recognized in continuing operations using the percentage of completion method amounted to 3%, 2%, and 1% of total net sales, respectively.
We generally provide limited warranties related to our products which cover manufacturing in accordance with the specifications identified on the face of our quotation or order acknowledgment and to be free of defects in workmanship or materials. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration of one year. We estimate and accrue for potential warranty exposure related to products which have been delivered.
Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted
The information set forth under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted” is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7A.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price risk associated with our input costs. We utilize derivative instruments to manage selected foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. The interest expense associated with our long-term debt will vary with market rates. On March 30, 2020, Forterra entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a notional value of $400 million to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of the Term Loan. Under the terms of the swap transaction, Forterra agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest of 1.08% and receive floating rate of interest indexed to one-month LIBOR, subject to a minimum of 1.00%, with monthly settlement terms with the swap counterparty. The swap has a 30-month term and expires on September 30, 2022. At December 31, 2020, we estimate that 1% increase in the rates relating to the portion of our floating rate debt that is not hedged would increase annual interest requirements by approximately $5.1 million.
Borrowings under our Term Loan and our Revolver may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which are expected to ultimately lead to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to cause LIBOR to become unavailable as a benchmark rate. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in a significant increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. We plan to carefully monitor the situation and may seek
to renegotiate the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate with our lenders in the future. See Item 1A. ""Risk Factors.""
Foreign Currency Risk
Approximately 5.1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were made in countries outside of the U.S. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Based upon our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that a 1% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies would affect net sales by approximately $0.8 million. This may differ from actual results depending on the levels of net sales outside of the U.S.
Commodity Price Risk
We are subject to commodity price risks with respect to price changes mainly in the electricity and natural gas markets and other raw material costs, such as cement, aggregates, scrap and steel. Price fluctuations on our key inputs have a significant effect on our financial performance. The markets for most of these commodities are cyclical and are affected by factors such as global economic conditions, changes in or disruptions to industry production capacity, changes in inventory levels and other factors beyond our control.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. We provide our products to customers based on an evaluation of the financial condition of our customers, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition. We monitor the exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion among many different geographies.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an individual customer within our Water Pipe & Products segment that accounted for more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The customer represented approximately 16% and 15% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and had total receivables at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaling 16% and 13% of our total receivables, net, respectively.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Forterra, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Forterra, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Realizability of deferred tax assets
Description of the Matter
As more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences of $87.1 million, net of a $1.7 million valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Auditing management’s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets involved complex auditor judgment because management’s estimate is highly judgmental and based on significant assumptions that may be affected by future market or economic conditions.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets. This included controls over management’s scheduling of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and projections of future taxable income.
Among other audit procedures performed, we tested the Company’s scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences, including evaluation of the timing of the reversal pattern. We evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income by jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in its projections. For example, we compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management’s consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s projections and compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company.

1. Organization and description of the business
General
Forterra, Inc. (‘‘Forterra’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) is involved in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of building products in the United States (‘‘U.S.’’) and Eastern Canada. Forterra’s primary products are concrete drainage pipe, precast concrete structures, and water transmission pipe used in drinking and wastewater systems. These products are used in the residential, infrastructure and non-residential sectors of the construction industry.
Forterra, a Delaware corporation, was formed on June 21, 2016 to hold the business of Forterra Building Products following an internal reorganization transaction in connection with its initial public offering in 2016 (""IPO"").
The business of Forterra Building Products included indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd., (""LSF9""). Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P., which is referred to along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding the Company and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as Lone Star, through its wholly-owned subsidiary LSF9, acquired the business of Forterra Building Products on March 13, 2015, (‘‘Acquisition’’). LSF9, which was formed on February 6, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring the business of Forterra Building Products had no operations prior to the date of the Acquisition.
Initial Public Offering
On October 6, 2016, Forterra filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1,000 with a par value of $0.01 per share to 190,000,000 with a par value of $0.001 per share, and, immediately after which, effected a 41,619.472 for one stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Following the stock split there were 41,619,472 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has also authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock that may be issued at the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
On October 25, 2016, Forterra sold 18,420,000 shares of common stock in its IPO at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $313.3 million in the IPO before offering costs.
Reorganization
Prior to the consummation of the IPO, LSF9 distributed its brick operations in the United States and Eastern Canada to an affiliate of Lone Star, or the Bricks Disposition, recognized as a return of capital in the statement of shareholders' equity. Following the Bricks Disposition and prior to the consummation of the IPO, the remaining building products operations of LSF9 in the United States and Eastern Canada, were transferred to Forterra, Inc. in an internal reorganization under common control transaction (the ""Reorganization""). Following the Reorganization, Forterra, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Forterra US Holdings, LLC, which is indirectly wholly owned by an affiliate of Lone Star.
Refinancing
Concurrent with the completion of the IPO, Forterra entered into a new asset based revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes, (the ""Revolver""), and a new $1.05 billion senior term loan facility (""Term Loan""). On May 1, 2017, the Company amended the Term Loan to increase the principal outstanding by an additional $200.0 million and to reduce the interest margin applicable to the full balance thereof. The terms of the Term Loan and Revolver are described in greater detail in Note 11, Debt and deferred financing costs.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of Forterra, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’). Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations.
Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combination transactions, as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 805, Business Combination, are recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the purchase price of acquisitions based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions. Initial purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of the transaction. The fair value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be based upon the discounted cash flow method that involves inputs that are not observable in the market (Level 3). Goodwill assigned represents the amount of consideration transferred in excess of the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the reporting date, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. The more significant estimates made by management relate to fair value estimates for assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations; estimates for accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup, bodily injury and insurance claims; estimates for commitments and contingencies; and estimates for the realizability of deferred tax assets, the tax receivable agreement obligation, inventory reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.
Certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information were assessed in light of the impact from the coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19"") pandemic. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, goodwill impairment, impairment of property and equipment and valuation allowances for tax assets. While the assessments resulted in no material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company believes the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains uncertain and will continue to assess if ongoing developments related to the outbreak may cause future material impacts to its consolidated financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and other highly liquid investments having an original maturity of less than three months.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
Receivables, net
Receivables are recorded at net realizable value, which includes allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company reviews the collectability of trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The Company reserves for trade receivables determined to be uncollectible. This determination is based on the delinquency of the account, the financial condition of the customer and the Company’s collection experience.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral from its customers. The allowances for uncollectible receivables are based upon analysis of economic trends in the construction industry, detailed analysis of the expected collectibility of accounts receivable that are past due and the expected collectibility of overall receivables.
The Company had an individual customer within its Water Pipe & Products segment that accounted for approximately 16% and 15% of the Company's total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and total receivables at December 31, 2020 and 2019 representing 16% and 13% of the Company's total receivables, net, respectively.
Credit Losses
Trade accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.
The Company's exposure to credit losses may increase if one or more of its customers are adversely affected by changes in laws or other government recommendations or mandates, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption or other impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. Although the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade receivables as customers are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Concentration of Labor
Approximately 33% of the Company’s employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements, and 24% of these employees are included in collective bargaining agreements that expire within 12 months.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company’s inventories are valued using the average cost and first-in-first-out methods. Inventories include materials, labor and applicable factory overhead costs. The value of inventory is adjusted for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. Market value of inventory is estimated considering the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions, and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of each respective component of inventory.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under capital lease arrangements, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. These lives range from 20 to 40 years for buildings, 4 to 20 years for machinery and equipment, and 5 to 10 years for other equipment and lower of lease term or useful life on leasehold improvements. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company’s depreciation expense is recorded in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. The Company capitalizes interest during the active construction of major projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is depreciated over the useful lives of those assets. There was no interest capitalized for any of the periods presented in the financial statements.
Impairment or disposal of long-lived assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). ASC 360 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the Company’s products, capital needs, economic trends in the construction sector and other factors. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value.
Leases
The Company has both capital and finance leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities, and long-term finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For machinery and equipment leases, such as forklifts, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any rent-free periods. Operating lease expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $15.6 million, $16.5 million and $24.3 million, respectively.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net
Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires goodwill to be either qualitatively or quantitatively
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
assessed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for each reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year and in interim periods if events occur that would indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The Company evaluates its intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite lives consist of customer relationships, customer backlogs, and brand names, and are amortized under the consumption method over the estimated useful lives. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the Company's use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company's overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, the Company makes an assessment of the recoverability of the net book value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period, the Company reduces the net book value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period.
Investment in equity method investee
The Company has an investment in a joint venture accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company's share of the investee's earnings and losses, as well as capital contributions to and distributions from the investee. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies its share of income and loss related to its investments in its investee as a component of operating income or loss, as the Company's investments in the investee is an extension of the Company's core business operations.
The Company evaluates its investment in the equity method investee for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its investment may have experienced an ""other-than-temporary"" decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is ""other-than-temporary"" based on its assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company's intent and ability to retain its investment.
Derivatives and Hedge Accounting
The Company has entered into derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk. Certain derivative instruments are designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815-20, Derivatives - Hedging. Instruments that meet hedge criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the instrument.
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value. Fair value related to the cash flows occurring within one year are classified as current and the fair value related to the cash flows occurring beyond one year are classified as non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. For those instruments designated as hedges, the Company recognizes the changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), and recognizes any ineffectiveness immediately in earnings.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
Valuation of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Company’s own credit standing.
Deferred financing costs
In conjunction with its debt, the Company had a net balance of $14.8 million in debt discounts and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020. These costs are amortized over the life of the applicable debt instrument to interest expense utilizing the effective interest method. The Company wrote-off deferred debt issuance cost of $13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the repayment of a portion of the term loan at par with the proceeds from the offering of the senior secured notes. See Note 11, Debt and deferred financing costs.
Fair value measurement
The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.
The Company's other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative financial instruments and long-term debt. The carrying value of the Company’s trade and other receivables, trade payables and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their highly liquid nature, short-term maturity, or competitive rates assigned to these financial instruments.
The Company adjusts the carrying amount of certain non-financial assets to fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are impaired.
Foreign currency translation
The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for operations in the U.S. and Mexico, and the Canadian dollar for operations in Canada. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company’s Canadian operations are translated in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
Environmental remediation liabilities
The Company accrues for costs on an undiscounted basis associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable; if an estimated amount is likely to fall within a range and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Claims for recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties are not recorded until it is probable that the recoveries will be realized. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits are capitalized. At December 31, 2020
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
and 2019, the Company had environmental obligations of $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which are recorded within accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Stock-based plans
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, in its accounting and reporting for stock-based compensation. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. All unvested options outstanding under the Company's option plans have grant prices equal to the market price of the Company's stock on the dates of grant. Compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized over the required service period, or over a shorter period when employee retirement eligibility is a factor. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Awards that may be settled in cash or company stock are classified as liabilities and remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period until the awards are settled.
Income Taxes
The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the asset/liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company uses the period cost method for Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, and therefore, has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction, including past operating results, future reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions only if it believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company evaluates whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold using the assumption that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based upon the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties, should they occur, are included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Revenue recognition
The Company's revenue contracts are primarily single performance obligations for the sale of product both to trade customers and distributors. A majority of revenue recognized by the Company is recognized at the time control is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. The Company considers several indicators for the transfer of control to its customers, including the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products, the Company's right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based upon the assessment of control indicators, sales to trade customers and distributors are generally recognized when products are delivered to customers.
All variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, rebates, returns and credits, is included in net sales. Estimates for variable consideration are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and management's judgment. Generally, the Company's contracts do not contain significant financing.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
For certain engineering and construction contracts and building contracting arrangements, the Company enters into long-term contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized as the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time using an acceptable input method to measure the progress toward completion of the performance obligation if: the customer receives the benefits as work is performed, the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and the Company has a contractual right to payment. The Company uses its cost incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. The Company's contract liabilities consist of billings to customers in excess of revenue recognized which the Company records as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, which was included in contract liabilities at the beginning of each period was not material. Contract assets include revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed, and balances billed but not yet paid by customers under retainage provisions which are classified as a current asset within receivables, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no material contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue recognized in continuing operations using the percentage of completion method amounted to 3%, 2%, and 1% and of total net sales, respectively.
The Company records net sales including taxes collected on behalf of its customers. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as contract fulfillments costs and classified as cost of goods sold. See Note 20, Segment reporting, for the Company's disaggregated revenue disclosures.
The Company incurs shipping costs to third parties for the transportation of building products and bills such costs to customers. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded freight costs of approximately $122.7 million, $131.8 million and $127.0 million, respectively, on a gross basis within net sales and cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company generally provides limited warranties related to its products which cover manufacturing in accordance with the specifications identified on the face of its quotation or order acknowledgment and to be free of defects in workmanship or materials. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration of one year. The Company estimates and accrues for potential warranty exposure related to products which have been delivered.
Cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses
Cost of goods sold includes costs of production, inbound freight charges for raw materials, outbound freight to customers, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and warehousing at plant distribution facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs include expenses for sales, marketing, legal, accounting and finance services, human resources, customer support, treasury and other general corporate services.
Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires the use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective approach, which did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in the ASU provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The guidance was effective upon issuance and
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
generally can be applied through December 31, 2022 and has not had any material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance required disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The Company adopted Topic 842 during the first quarter of 2019, using the transition approach that permits application of the new standard at the adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
To adopt Topic 842, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward its historical assessments of (1) whether the existing contracts contained a lease, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) initial direct cost for existing leases. In addition to the package of practical expedients, the Company has elected the adoption expedients of (1) the exclusion of leases with terms less than 12 months, and (2) the election not to separate non-lease components from lease components for certain classes of underlying leased assets.
To adopt Topic 842, the Company recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance sheet presented January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on its consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows. As a result of the adoption, the Company has recorded additional lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $63.9 million and $65.2 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company recognized the carrying value of deferred gains related to certain sale and operating leaseback of land of $9.3 million, net of tax impact of $2.3 million, to beginning retained deficit as of January 1, 2019, in accordance with ASC 842-10-65-1.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the guidance provided in the ASU during the first quarter of 2018 and reclassified $0.8 million of stranded deferred tax benefits related to its derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained deficit.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, hybrid taxes, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. For public companies, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in interim or annual periods with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, entities that elect early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. Amendments are to be applied prospectively, except for certain amendments that are to be applied either retrospectively or with a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings. The effects of this standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements are not expected to be material.

3. Acquisitions and divestitures
The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as business combinations (except as discussed below) as defined by ASC 805. The Company allocated the purchase price to the individually identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill. The determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities required significant judgment, including estimates impacting the determination of estimated lives of tangible and intangible assets, calculation of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, inventory, and various intangibles. The fair values of assets and liabilities were determined using level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820.
2019 transactions
On March 1, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets of Texas limited liability companies Houston Buckner Precast, LLC, Buckner Precast, LLC, Montgomery 18905 E. Industrial, LLC, and 1763 Old Denton Road, LLC (altogether ""Buckner"") for consideration of $11.8 million in cash, inclusive of a working capital adjustment. The acquired Buckner assets did not meet the definition of a business and, as such, the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition pursuant to the guidance in subsection 805-50 of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The assets of the Buckner acquisition operate as part of the Company’s Drainage Pipe & Products segment.
2018 transactions
Acquisitions
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Watkins Industries, Inc. for aggregate consideration of $4.5 million in cash and accounted for the transaction as a business combination. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of Anchor Concrete Products, Ltd. in Kingston, Ontario, for aggregate consideration of $2.5 million in cash and accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Both of these acquisitions operate in the Company's Drainage Pipe & Products segment.
Divestitures
On January 31, 2018, the Company divested assets relating to the operation of certain Drainage Pipe & Products facilities in Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia to Foley Products Company (“Foley”) in exchange for $9.1 million in cash, land in Texas and a Drainage Pipe & Products facility located in Prentiss, Mississippi.
The acquisition side of the exchange transaction was accounted for as a business combination as defined by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, the purchase price is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred by the Company to Foley in the exchange. In the exchange, the Company divested of the net working capital and certain of the real property of its Drainage Pipe & Products plants in Tennessee and Alabama, as well as the net working capital of certain Drainage Pipe & Products plants in Georgia. The purchase price of $37.2 million was the fair value of the divested assets which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $6.0 million, recognized in Other income (expense), net. The Company allocated the purchase price to the individually identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill.
The determination of fair values of the divested and acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant judgment, including estimates impacting the determination of estimated lives of tangible and intangible assets, calculation of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, inventory, and various intangibles. The fair values of assets and liabilities were determined using level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.

8. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net
The Company has goodwill which has been recorded in connection with its acquisition of businesses. The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has three reporting units which have goodwill. We perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill & Other, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality and events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary and our goodwill is considered to be unimpaired. However, if based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed with performing the quantitative impairment test.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of the qualitative assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
For quantitative impairment test, the Company uses a combination of an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach uses a reporting unit's estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third-party buyer. The market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting unit. The calculation of business enterprise value is based on significant unobservable inputs, such as price trends, customer demand, material costs and discount rates, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. Different assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1st of each year. In 2020, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative test was necessary. In 2019 and 2018, we performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that the calculated fair value of the reporting units exceeded book value in all circumstances; therefore, no annual impairment charge was recorded in either of these periods.

9. Fair value measurement
The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, derivative instruments, accounts payable, long-term debt, operating and finance lease liabilities, accrued liabilities and the tax receivable agreement obligation. The carrying value of the Company's trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, the asset-based revolver and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity or other terms related to these financial instruments. The Company may adjust the carrying amount of certain non-financial assets to fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are impaired.

Liabilities and assets classified as level 2 which are recorded at fair value are valued using observable market inputs. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates and exchange rates to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counter-party credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Company incorporates within its fair value measurements a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counter-parties, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counter-party credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Company’s own credit risk.
The estimated carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s financial instruments and liabilities for which fair value is only disclosed is as follows (in thousands):

The fair value of debt is valued using a market approach based on the indicative quoted prices for the Company's debt instruments traded in over-the-counter markets and, therefore, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 11, Debt and deferred financing costs, for a further discussion of Company debt.
The fair value of the tax receivable agreement payable was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value required significant judgment, including estimates of the timing and amounts of various tax attributes. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ from these estimates. See Note 16, Commitments and contingencies, for a further discussion of the Company's tax receivable agreement.

As of December 31, 2020, Forterra had no borrowings under its $350 million asset based revolving credit facility under its ABL Credit Agreement dated October 25, 2016 (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) for working capital and general corporate purposes (“Revolver”), $414.9 million outstanding under its senior term loan facility (“Term Loan”) and $500 million senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Notes”).
Senior Secured Notes
On July 16, 2020, Forterra Finance, LLC and FRTA Finance Corp., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due in 2025. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.50% which will be paid semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Notes will mature on July 15, 2025. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay $492.5 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan at par, plus accrued interest. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $8.8 million and will amortize them over the term of the Notes under the effective interest method.
Obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Company and the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries (other than the issuing companies) that guarantee the Term Loan and the obligations of the U.S. borrowers under the Revolver. The Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the collateral that secures the Term Loan on a first-priority basis (which is generally all assets other than those that secure the Revolver on a first-priority basis as set forth below) and second-priority liens on the collateral that secures the Revolver on a first-priority basis (which is generally inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, certain intercompany loans and related assets), which second-priority liens will be ratable with the liens on such assets securing the obligations under the Term Loan and junior to the liens on such assets securing the Revolver.
At any time prior to July 15, 2022, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus a “make whole premium” as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, subject to the right of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2022, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any additional notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 106.500% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date), with the net cash proceeds of an equity offering. Furthermore, at any time on or after July 15, 2022, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date:
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
The Notes contain customary negative covenants, including, among other things, limitations or prohibitions on restricted payments, incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Indenture contains customary events of default.
Senior Term Loan
The Term Loan provides for a $1.25 billion senior secured term loan. Subject to the conditions set forth in the term loan agreement, the Term Loan may be increased by (i) up to the greater of $285.0 million and 1.0x consolidated EBITDA (defined below) of Forterra and its restricted subsidiaries for the four quarters most recently ended prior to such incurrence plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any voluntary prepayments, plus (iii) an additional unlimited amount, provided (x) in the case of any incremental debt that is secured by a lien that is pari passu with the liens securing the Term Loan, the first lien leverage ratio does not exceed 4.10 to 1.00, (y) in the case of incremental debt that is secured by a lien that is junior to the liens securing the Term Loan, the total leverage ratio does not exceed 5.50 to 1.00 and (z) in the case of incremental debt that is unsecured, the total leverage ratio does not exceed 5.75 to 1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis.
The Term Loan matures on October 25, 2023 and is subject to quarterly amortization equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount. Interest accrues on outstanding borrowings thereunder at a rate equal to adjusted LIBOR (with a floor of 1.0%) or an alternate base rate (the base rate, which is the highest of the then current federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under the Term Loan, and the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%), in each case plus a margin of 3.00% or 2.00%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates for the Term Loan were 4.1% and 5.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased $696.0 million of the Term Loan before its maturity at a market value of $695.1 million. Consequently, the Company wrote off a proportionate share of debt issuance costs of $13.1 million and recognized a net loss of $12.2 million which was included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan are guaranteed by Forterra and each of its direct and indirect material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries (the ""Guarantors""). The Term Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of Forterra, the borrower and the Guarantors; provided that the obligations under the Term Loan are not secured by any liens on more than 65% of the voting stock of foreign subsidiaries or assets of foreign subsidiaries. The Term Loan contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, that, among other things, restrict the ability of Forterra and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, engage in asset sales and pay dividends and make distributions. The Term Loan does not contain any financial covenants. Obligations under the Term Loan may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate).
Asset Based Revolving Facility
On June 17, 2020, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the ABL Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other things, (i) increased the size of the Revolver from $300 million to $350 million of aggregate commitments, with up to $330 million to be made available to the U.S. Borrowers and up to $20 million to be made available to the Canadian Borrowers (the allocation may be modified periodically at the Company's request), (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolver to June 17, 2025, subject to earlier maturity if
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
greater than $75.0 million of the Company’s Term Loan remains outstanding 91 days prior to the scheduled maturity of the term loan credit facility or any refinancing thereof, and (iii) modified the interest rates on outstanding borrowings under the Revolver to a rate equal to LIBOR or CDOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, or an alternate base rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% per annum, in each case, based upon the average excess availability under the Revolver for the most recently completed calendar quarter and the Company’s total leverage ratio as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. The Company incurred $2.6 million of fees and expenses in connection with this Amendment and recorded it to “Other Long-term Assets” in its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company wrote off $0.4 million of previously deferred issuance cost related to the banks that are no longer part of the ABL Credit Facility.
Subject to the conditions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, as amended, the Revolver may be increased by up to the greater of (i) $100.0 million and (ii) such amount as would not cause the aggregate borrowing base to be exceeded by more than $50.0 million. Borrowings under the Revolver may not exceed a borrowing base equal to the sum of (i) 100% of eligible cash, (ii) 85% of eligible accounts receivable and (iii) the lesser of (a) 75% of eligible inventory and (b) 85% of the orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, with the U.S. and Canadian borrowings being subject to separate borrowing base limitations. The advance rates for accounts receivable and inventory are subject to increase by 2.5% during certain periods. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Revolver had no outstanding borrowings. The weighted average interest rates for the borrowings under the Revolver were 2.00% and 3.72% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
The Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to an agreed sublimit. The obligations of the borrowers under the Revolver are guaranteed by Forterra and its direct and indirect wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries other than certain excluded subsidiaries; provided that the obligations of the U.S. borrowers are not guaranteed by the Canadian subsidiaries. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers; provided that the obligations of the U.S. borrowers are not secured by any liens on more than 65% of the voting stock of foreign subsidiaries or assets of foreign subsidiaries.
In addition, Forterra pays a facility fee of between 20.0 and 32.5 basis points per annum based upon the utilization of the total Revolver. Availability under the Revolver, based on draws, outstanding letters of credit of $16.7 million, as well as allowable borrowing base as of December 31, 2020, was $235.6 million.
The Revolver and the Term Loan contain customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including representations, warranties, and covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Forterra and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, engage in asset sales and pay dividends and make distributions. The Revolver contains a financial covenant restricting Forterra from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to drop below 1.00:1.00 during a compliance period, which is triggered when the availability under the Revolver falls below a threshold set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, as amended. Obligations under the Revolver and the Term Loan may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate). The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA’’) less cash payments for capital expenditures and income taxes to consolidated fixed charges (interest expense plus scheduled payments of principal on indebtedness).
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Revolver, the Term Loan, and the Notes.

13. Derivatives and hedging
The Company uses derivatives to manage selected foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes, and, except as discussed below, cash flows from derivative instruments are included in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
On March 30, 2020, Forterra entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a notional value of $400 million to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of the Term Loan. Under the terms of the swap transaction, Forterra agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest of 1.08% and receive floating rate of interest indexed to one-month LIBOR, subject to a minimum of 1.00%, with monthly settlement terms with the swap counterparty. The swap has a 30-month term and expires on September 30, 2022. The interest rate swap is not designated as a cash flow hedge, therefore all changes in the fair value of the instrument are captured as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, cash flows from the monthly interest rate swap settlements are included in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges in accordance with ASC 815-20 Derivatives - Hedging, which allowed for the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the instruments to be captured in accumulated other comprehensive income, and ineffective portion recorded in earnings. These instruments were novated to Forterra by an affiliate concurrent with the Reorganization, directly prior to the IPO and refinancing described in Note 1 and were settled in March 2018 resulting in a cash outlay of $5.0 million. This cash outlay was recorded within the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. The net investment hedges were intended to
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. A quantitative analysis was utilized to assess hedge effectiveness for the hedges. The Company assessed the hedge effectiveness and measured the amount of ineffectiveness for the hedge relationships based on changes in forward exchange rates; any ineffectiveness was recorded immediately in current period earnings. The Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Cumulative changes in fair value of the effective portion of the hedging instruments were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified into earnings upon the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity.
On February 9, 2017, Forterra entered into interest rate swap transactions with a combined notional value of $525 million. Under the terms of the swap transactions, Forterra agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest of 1.52% and receive floating rate interest indexed to one-month LIBOR with monthly settlement terms with the swap counterparties. The swaps had a three-year term and expired on March 31, 2020. The interest rate swaps were not designated as cash flow hedges, therefore all changes in the fair value of these instruments were captured as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, cash flows from the monthly interest rate swap settlements were included in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company elects to present all derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a net basis on its consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreement exists. An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, and such ISDA Master Agreement generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s derivative instruments fall under an ISDA master netting agreement.

14. Leases
The Company leases land and buildings, office spaces, vehicles, machinery and equipment under various lease agreements. A large portion of the Company’s leases were the result of the sale and leaseback of land and buildings related to certain production facilities. These leases have an initial term of 25 years, followed by one optional renewal term of approximately ten years that may be exercised at the Company’s discretion. See note 15, Sale-Leaseback transaction. These leases, with the exception of certain land leases, were classified as finance leases. The Company’s operating leases are mainly comprised of land and buildings, office spaces, vehicles, machinery and equipment leases, and have remaining terms of one to 25 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to ten years.

During April 2016, the Company sold 49 US and Canadian properties to Pipe Portfolio Owner (Multi) LP, (the ""U.S. Buyer"") and FORT-BEN Holdings (ONQC) Ltd., (the ""Canadian Buyer"") and entered into master land and building lease agreements under which the Company agreed to lease back each of the properties for an initial term of twenty years, followed by one optional renewal term of 9 years, 11 months. A deferred gain of $81.5 million related to the sale-leaseback transaction was being amortized over the life of the master leases. In addition, the Company concluded that the leases for land and buildings were operating leases, and the leases for the machinery equipment were capital leases. In October 2016, the Company entered into agreements to replace the original guarantor with Forterra, as the new guarantor, effective immediately following completion of the internal reorganization effected prior to the IPO. Due to the change in guarantor, the sale leaseback qualified for sales recognition and was classified as an operating lease beginning October 2016.
On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into exchange agreements and Amended and Restated Master Leases with each of the U.S Buyer and the Canadian Buyer (collectively, the “Exchange Transaction”). Under the exchange agreement between the Company and the U.S. Buyer, the Company exchanged ownership of a ductile iron pipe facility located in Bessemer, Alabama used in its Water Pipe & Products segment (the “Bessemer Facility”) for 21 facilities used in its Drainage Pipe & Products segment and the U.S. concrete and steel pressure pipe facilities previously part of the Water Pipe & Products segment, including a portion of one property used in both segments, all of which were previously included in the sale-leaseback transaction. Under the exchange agreement between the Company and the Canadian Buyer, the Company exchanged ownership of a smaller diameter ductile iron pipe facility located in Bessemer, Alabama used in its Water Pipe & Products segment (the “Mini Mill Facility”) for ownership of three Canadian concrete pressure pipe facilities that were previously included in the sale-leaseback transaction. No cash changed hands in the Exchange Transaction.

Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
Under the Amended and Restated Master Leases, the Company leases 26 properties from the U.S. Buyer and 2 properties from an affiliate of the Canadian Buyer, each for an initial term of 25 years, through June 30, 2043, followed by one optional renewal term of nine years, eleven months that may be exercised at the Company’s option. The initial base rent under the U.S. Amended and Restated Master Lease is $17.1 million per annum, payable monthly, and is subject to a 2% annual increase during the initial term. If the Company elects to extend the term of the U.S. Amended and Restated Master Lease, the base rent for the first year of the extension will be the greater of 95% of the fair market rental value of the properties and an amount equal to 102% of the prior year’s base rent, subject to an annual increase based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, but capped at 4%. The U.S. Amended and Restated Master Lease restricts the Company’s use of the U.S. properties to heavy manufacturing, industrial, and other related uses. The Company cannot sublease or assign the properties covered by the U.S. Amended and Restated Master Lease without the prior written consent of the U.S. Landlord and subject to certain other restrictions. The terms of the Canadian Amended and Restated Master Lease are similar to those of the U.S. Amended and Restated Master Lease described above, except that the initial base rent is $1.2 million (CAD) per annum. The Company’s aggregate liability in connection with its representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification and other obligations is $5.0 million under the U.S. Exchange Agreement and $6.4 million (CAD) under the Canadian Exchange Agreement, subject to limited exceptions.
The Company accounted for the Exchange Transaction in accordance with the sale-leaseback accounting guidance under ASC 840, Leases. The fair value of the 24 facilities exchanged back was $86.1 million and was accounted for as the proceeds from the sale of the Bessemer and Mini Mill Facilities after adjusting for the transaction cost of $2.7 million. Consequently, a deferred gain of $67.3 million was recorded at June 5, 2018. The carrying value of the deferred gains of $35.0 million, the deferred rent of $3.1 million, and the deferred transaction costs of $2.4 million from the original sale-leaseback transaction were reclassified to reduce the carrying value of the 24 facilities exchanged back.
The Amended and Restated Master Leases extended the lease terms for all facilities, which caused the majority of the leases to be classified as capital leases instead of operating leases. Consequently, the Company recognized capital lease obligations as well as the gross value of the capital lease assets of $149.0 million, calculated by discounting minimum future lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate of 12.33%. The carrying value of the deferred gains of $100.0 million, the deferred rent of $3.8 million, and the deferred transaction cost of $5.7 million were reclassified to reduce the carrying value of capital lease assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $10.0 million of rent expense in cost of goods sold for operating leases, related to payments made under the sales leaseback transaction. See Note 14 for rent expense relating to the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.
16. Commitments and contingencies
The Company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Other than routine litigation incidental to the Company's business and those matters described below, there are no material legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or to which any of the Company’s properties are subject.
Earnout Dispute
On March 13, 2015, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P. (which is referred to, along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding Forterra and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as ""Lone Star"") acquired the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG, (""Heidelberg""), in the United States and Eastern Canada, (the ""Acquisition""). The Acquisition purchase agreement included an earnout, which provided for the payment of contingent consideration of up to $100.0 million, if and to the extent the 2015 financial results of the businesses acquired by Lone Star in the Acquisition, including the Company and Heidelberg's former building products business in the United Kingdom, exceeded a specified Adjusted EBITDA target for fiscal year 2015, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. If
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
such Adjusted EBITDA calculation exceeded the specified target, LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd. (""LSF9"") and, as a result of the internal reorganization transaction effected prior to the Company's initial public offering (""IPO""), the Company would be required to pay the U.S. affiliate of Heidelberg an amount equal to a multiple of such excess Adjusted EBITDA, with any payment capped at $100.0 million. In April 2016, the Company provided an earnout statement to affiliates of Heidelberg demonstrating that no payment was required. On June 13, 2016, Heidelberg provided notification that it disputed, among other things, the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the purchase agreement and asserting that a payment should be made in the amount of $100.0 million. On October 5, 2016, affiliates of Heidelberg filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking specific performance and claiming access to the Company's books, records, and personnel; seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the scope of the neutral accounting expert’s authority; and in the alternative, claiming a breach of contract and seeking the $100.0 million and other damages (the ""Delaware Action""). On December 8, 2017, the court granted the defendants' Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint in the Delaware Action, finding that the earnout dispute should be heard before a neutral accounting arbitrator as set forth in the purchase agreement and that any claims that were required to be brought as indemnification claims under the purchase agreement were time-barred by the contractual limitations period. Following the dismissal of the Delaware Action, the Company and Heidelberg jointly engaged a neutral accounting expert to act as an arbitrator in the dispute as required by the purchase agreement. After briefing certain preliminary matters for the arbitrator and the production of additional documents, the parties began briefing the issues on the merits for the neutral accounting arbitrator, which was completed in April 2020. A hearing on the dispute was held in June 2020, and a written decision was issued by the neutral accounting arbitrator on September 10, 2020 in which the arbitrator ruled that no earnout payment was owed in the matter. The deadline for Heidelberg to take any action to overturn the ruling was in December 2020, and they took no action, so the Company believes the ruling is final. As of December 31, 2020, no liability for this contingency has been accrued as payment of any earnout is not considered probable.
Derivative Action
On January 15, 2019, a putative shareholder derivative complaint captioned Lee v. Bradley, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, naming as defendants certain of the Company’s current and former directors and officers (the ""Lee Action""). The complaint alleges the defendants violated Section 14A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related rules by failing to make certain disclosures in the Company's proxy solicitation in advance of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and that defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and committed constructive fraud. The complaint also asserts unjust enrichment claims against certain defendants. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the Company, unspecified damages, an order directing the return of certain payments to the defendants, certain injunctive relief, and reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. After initially staying the case until the court in a prior, unrelated securities class action suit that has now been settled ruled on the motion to dismiss in that case, on December 11, 2019, the court in the Lee Action entered a Stipulation and Order consolidating the Lee Action and another derivative action filed in the same court into a single case (the ""Consolidated Lee Action""), and providing a schedule for filing of an amended complaint and motions to dismiss, which has been further extended by agreement of the parties. A mediation of the dispute was held on June 12, 2020 but was not successful in resolving the dispute. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2020 and Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in September 2020, which is now fully briefed and before the court and a decision is expected in the coming months.
The Company and other defendants are vigorously defending the Consolidated Lee Action. Given the stage of the proceedings, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may arise from the Consolidated Lee Action.
Long-term incentive plan
Following the Acquisition, Lone Star implemented a cash-based long term incentive plan (the “LTIP”), which entitles the participants in the LTIP a potential cash payout upon a monetization event as defined by the LTIP. Potential monetization events include the sale, transfer or otherwise disposition of all or a portion of the Company or successor entities of LSF9, an initial public offering where Lone Star sells/reduces its ownership in the Company or successor entities of LSF9, or through certain cash distribution as defined in the LTIP. Before
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
the payout of any cash the LTIP requires Lone Star realize in cash the full return of their investment plus a specified internal rate of return, which is calculated by comparing the return to Lone Star over the timeline of its investment in the Company and certain successor entities of LSF9. As of December 31, 2020, no such monetization events that meet the required return for an LTIP payment have occurred, and therefore no amounts were accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. While no payments have occurred thus far, payments under the LTIP could be significant depending upon future monetization events. The timing and amount of such payments are unknown and is dependent upon future monetization events and market conditions that are outside of the control of the Company or the participants of the plan. Subsequent to the IPO, Forterra became directly liable for any payment obligations triggered under the LTIP, but LSF9 or one of its affiliates will remain obligated to make payments to the Company in amounts equal to any payment obligations triggered under the LTIP as and when such payment obligations are triggered.
Leases
The Company leases certain property and equipment for various periods under non-cancelable operating and finance leases. See Note 14 for future minimum lease payments under such agreements.
Tax receivable agreement
The Company has a tax receivable agreement (the ""TRA"") with Lone Star that provides for, among other things, the payment by the Company to Lone Star of 85% of the amount of certain covered tax benefits, which may reduce the actual liability for certain taxes that the Company might otherwise be required to pay. The tax benefits subject to the TRA include: (i) all depreciation and amortization deductions, and any offset to taxable income and gain or increase to taxable loss, resulting from the tax basis that the Company had in its assets as of the time of the consummation of the IPO, (ii) the utilization of the Company's and its subsidiaries’ net operating losses and tax credits, if any, attributable to periods prior to the IPO, (iii) deductions in respect of payments made, funded or reimbursed by an initial party to the tax receivable agreement (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) or an affiliate thereof to participants under the LTIP, (iv) deductions in respect of transaction expenses attributable to the acquisition of USP Holdings, Inc., and (v) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement.
For purposes of the TRA, the aggregate reduction in income tax payable by the Company will be computed by comparing the Company's actual income tax liability with its hypothetical liability had it not been able to utilize the related tax benefits. The agreement will remain in effect for the period of time in which all such related tax benefits remain. The Company accounts for potential payments under the tax receivable agreement as a contingent liability, with amounts accrued when considered probable and reasonably estimable. The liabilities recorded by the Company for the tax receivable agreement at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $64.2 million and $77.4 million, respectively. The timing and amount of future tax benefits associated with the TRA are subject to change, and additional payments may be required which could be materially different from the current accrued liability. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the full value of the obligation recorded. Future tax receivable agreement payments related to the tax basis of assets at the time of the IPO will be recorded as a reduction to the liability and will be recorded as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company paid $13.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively on the TRA to Lone Star.
17. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities include employee stock options and shares of restricted stock. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed exercise or conversion of all dilutive securities. The restricted shares are considered participating securities for the purposes of the Company's EPS calculation.

Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
The calculations of the basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
are presented below (in thousands, except per share data):
Potential dilutive common shares were anti-dilutive as a result of the Company's net loss for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a result, basic weighted average shares were used in the calculations of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for those periods.
The number of stock options and restricted shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would result in an anti-dilutive effect on per share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 213,413, 2,192,048 and 2,749,348, respectively.
18. Employee benefit plans
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company’s employees are able to participate in a 401K defined contribution plan. The Company contributes funds into this plan subject to certain limits. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an expense of $13.0 million, $7.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively.
19. Stock-based plans
Stock Incentive Plans
The Company's previous equity compensation plan under which it granted stock awards was the Forterra, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, (the ""2016 Incentive Plan""). The aggregate number of shares of common stock that was initially available for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan was 5,000,000 shares. The Company's board of directors has granted employees and independent directors options to purchase shares of common stock, shares of restricted common stock and restricted stock units. The options, restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees are subject to either three-year or four-year vesting periods and the options, restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to independent directors are subject to a one-year vesting period. The awards of stock options granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan have a term of ten years. In May 2018, the Company's shareholders approved the Forterra, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan, (the ""2018 Incentive Plan""). The 2018 Incentive Plan serves as the umbrella plan for the Company’s stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation programs for its directors, officers and other eligible employees. The aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 5,000,000 shares plus any shares subject to
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
outstanding awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan as of the date of the approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan that on or after such date cease for any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent they are exercised for or settled in nonforfeitable shares).
In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award or over a shorter period when employee retirement eligibility is a factor, in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments, which include stock options granted and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees members of Forterra's Board of Directors. The Company records stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $9.5 million, $7.9 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Stock Option Grants
The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. The Company utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the option grants in the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:
The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Expected volatility was calculated using a weighted average of Forterra and a set of Forterra's peer companies based on an analysis of historical and implied volatility measures. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
A summary of the status of the Company's stock options is presented below:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $1.0 million of unrecognized stock option compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.9 years.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Restricted stock are share awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company's common stock which become freely transferable upon vesting. Restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. Restricted stock units are share awards denominated in units of the Company's common stock and are subject to a service condition. The restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards generally vest one to four years from the date of grant and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the vesting date. The estimated compensation cost of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
During 2020, the Company granted 0.8 million restricted stock units consisting of 0.6 million time-vested restricted stock units and 0.2 million performance-based restricted stock units. During 2019, the Company granted 2.6 million restricted stock units consisting of 1.2 million time-vested restricted stock units and 1.4 million performance-based restricted stock units. The performance-based restricted stock units vest in tranches based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of FRTA common stock based on a grant date market condition. If the performance condition is achieved, one-fourth of the tranche will vest immediately and the remainder of the tranche will be time-vested over one year from the date the performance condition was met. The Company accounts for the time-vested and performance-based restricted stock units as equity awards.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
The following table summarizes the activity for restricted stock and restricted stock units:
At December 31, 2020, there was $6.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.
20. Income taxes
U.S. Tax Reform
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), that among other things, increased the net interest expense deduction limit to 50% of adjusted taxable income from 30% for tax years beginning January 1, 2019 and the tax year 2020, and amended Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 168(e)(3)(E) to retroactively include the qualified improvement property inadvertently classified as 39-year property under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) as property to which a 15-year recovery period applies and for which 100% bonus depreciation may be claimed. This enhanced bonus depreciation may be applied retro actively for additions after December 31, 2017.
In July of 2020, the Treasury Department released two significant final regulations: (1) final regulations with guidance on applying the limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense under IRC Section 163(j), which was significantly modified by TCJA and then temporarily modified by the CARES Act; and (2) final Section 951A regulations which allowed taxpayers to make an election to exclude certain high-taxed income of its controlled foreign corporations. The favorable impact of the CARES Act and these final regulations was reflected in the 2019 filed tax return, as well as in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using currently enacted tax rates.

The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to statutory federal, state and international income tax expense on the continuing operations, the unfavorable impact of non-deductible executive compensation and other non-deductible expenses, partially offset with the release of the valuation allowance on assets now expected to be realized prior to expiration and the favorable effect of the retroactive tax law changes included in the prior year federal and state tax return filings.
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible expenses, partially offset with the favorable effect of the partial reversal of the federal and state valuation allowances and the effect of the return to provision adjustments.
The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of the federal and state valuation allowance increase, inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income, and impact of the disposition of nondeductible goodwill in connection with the Foley exchange described in Note 3, partially offset with the favorable impact of the tax credits and state tax benefit.
FORTERRA, INC.
Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The Company assesses whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a “more likely than not” criteria. The analysis used in determining the valuation allowance involves considerable judgment and assumptions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, after consideration of all evidence, including the analysis of the reversal pattern of the taxable and deductible temporary differences in the future, as well as the positive factors of the recent business performance, the Company released $11.8 million of the federal, state and international valuation allowance.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The net deferred tax asset (liability) balances were comprised of the following components as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):

Uncertain tax positions
The Company is subject to audit examinations at federal, state, local, and foreign levels by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge the treatment or reporting of any tax return item. The tax matters challenged by the tax authorities are typically complex; therefore, the ultimate outcomes of these challenges are subject to uncertainty. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax audit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 was finalized during the year with no changes identified for either period, respectively. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return.
Each period the Company assesses uncertain tax positions for recognition, measurement and effective settlement. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that no liabilities for uncertain tax positions should be recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
21. Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and prepare separate financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in order to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company's Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. The Corporate and Other segment includes expenses related to certain executive salaries, interest costs related to the Company's credit agreements, acquisition related costs, and other corporate costs that are not directly attributable to the Company's operating segments. The Company's segments follow the same accounting policies as the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company moved its concrete and steel pressure pipe business from the Water Pipe & Products segment to the Drainage Pipe & Products segment to better align with how the CODM manages the businesses. The prior years have been restated to conform with the re-segmentation, which resulted in an immaterial impact to the prior periods' segment information.
Net sales from the major products sold to external customers include drainage pipe and precast products, and concrete and steel water transmission pipe.
The Company’s three geographic areas consist of the United States, Canada and Mexico for which it reports net sales, fixed assets and total assets. For purposes of evaluating segment profit, the CODM reviews
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as a basis for making the decisions to allocate resources and assess performance.

In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with Lone Star that provides for, among other things, the payment by the Company to Lone Star of 85% of the amount of certain covered tax benefits, which may reduce the actual liability for certain taxes that the Company might otherwise be required to pay. See further discussion in Note 16, Commitments and contingencies.
Bricks Joint Venture
Prior to the IPO, LSF9 distributed its brick operations in the United States and Eastern Canada to a joint venture formed by an affiliated of Lone Star (the ""Bricks Disposition""). In connection with the Bricks Disposition, Forterra entered into a transition services agreement with the joint venture, whereby Forterra would continue to provide certain administrative services, including but not limited to information technology, accounting and treasury for a limited period of time. Such transition services ended in February 2018. The Company recognized a total of $10 thousand in Other operating income, net pursuant to the transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management assessed the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 using the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in their report included below.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have a materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of our control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Forterra, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Forterra, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Forterra, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes, and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Overview
We are a provider of industrial products including electrical wire and cable, industrial fasteners, hardware and related services to the U.S. market. We sell electrical products through wholesale electrical distributors and fastener products through industrial distributors. As of December 31, 2020, we also sold mechanical wire and cable, fabricated steel wire rope and synthetic lifting and hardware products. We provide our customers with a single-source solution by offering a large selection of in-stock items, exceptional customer service and high levels of product expertise.
Our wide product selection and specialized services support our position in the supply chain between manufacturers and the customer. The breadth and depth of wire and cable, fasteners and related hardware that we offer requires significant warehousing resources and a large number of SKUs (stock-keeping units). While manufacturers may have the space and capabilities to maintain a large supply of inventory, we do not believe that any single manufacturer has the breadth and depth of product that we offer. More importantly, manufacturers historically have not offered the services that our customers need, such as complimentary custom cutting, cable coiling, paralleling, bundling, striping, cable management for large capital projects, and same day shipment, and do not have multiple distribution centers across the nation.
Our Cable Management Program addresses our customers’ requirement for sophisticated and efficient just-in-time product management for large capital projects. This program entails purchasing and storing dedicated inventory so our customers have immediate product availability for the duration of their projects. Advantages of this program include extra pre-allocated safety stock, firm pricing, zero cable surplus and just-in-time delivery. Used on large construction and capital expansion projects, our Cable Management Program combines the expertise of our cable specialists with dedicated project inventory and superior logistics to allow complex projects to be completed on time, within budget and with minimal residual waste.
History
We were founded in 1975 and have a long history of exceptional customer service, broad product selection and high levels of product expertise. In 1987, we completed our first initial public offering and were subsequently purchased in 1989 by ALLTEL Corporation and in 1997 by investment funds affiliated with Code, Hennessy & Simmons LLC. In 2006, we completed our second initial public offering. In 2010, we purchased Southwest Wire Rope LP (“Southwest”), its general partner Southwest Wire Rope GP LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Southern Wire (“Southern”), and subsequently merged the acquired businesses into our operating subsidiary. In 2016, we acquired Vertex Corporate Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries (“Vertex”) from DXP Enterprises. Vertex is a master distributor of industrial fasteners, and this acquisition expanded our product offerings to the industrial marketplace that purchases our wire and cable products. In December 2020, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Southern, and in March 2021, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Southwest (other than Southwest accounts receivable), to Southern Rigging Companies, LLC.
Products
We offer products in most categories of electrical wire and cable, including: continuous and interlocked armor cable; control and power cable; electronic wire and cable; flexible and portable cord; instrumentation and thermocouple cable; lead and high temperature cable; medium voltage cable; premise and category wire and cable, primary and secondary aluminum distribution cable, as well as hardware and corrosion resistant products including inch and metric bolts, screws, nuts, washers, rivets and hose clamps. We also offer private branded products, including our proprietary brand LifeGuard, a low-smoke, zero-halogen cable. Our products are used in repair and replacement work, also referred to as Maintenance, Repair and Operations (""MRO""), and related projects, larger-scale projects in the utility, industrial and infrastructure markets and a diverse range of industrial applications including communications, energy, engineering and construction, general manufacturing, marine construction and marine transportation, mining, infrastructure, oilfield services, petrochemical, transportation, utility, wastewater treatment and food and beverage.
Targeted Markets
Our business is driven, in part, by the strength, growth prospects and activity in the end-markets in which our products are used, which are primarily in the continental United States, where we target the utility, industrial and infrastructure markets.
Industrial Market. The industrial market is one of the largest segments of the U.S. economy and is comprised of a diverse base of manufacturing and production companies. The largest driver of our success in this market results from the level of U.S. investment in upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas exploration, transportation and production. We provide a wide variety of products specifically designed for use in manufacturing, metal/mineral, and oil and gas markets.
Utility Market. The utility market includes large investor-owned utilities, rural cooperatives and municipal power authorities. We are not a significant distributor of power lines used for the transmission of electricity but have products in our portfolio that are used in this sector. We sell our core products for the construction of power plants and the related pollution control equipment used to comply with environmental standards as well as plant modernizations implemented to extend the life of power generation facilities. Our customers utilize our cable management services to supply the wire and cable required in the construction of new power plants and upgrading of existing power plants.
Infrastructure Market. Investments in the development, construction and maintenance of infrastructure markets (including commercial buildings, education and health care; air, ground and rail transportation; telecommunications, and wastewater) are opportunities for our product and service offerings.
Distribution Logistics
Our national distribution presence and value-added services make us an essential partner in the supply chain for our suppliers, customers and end users. We have successfully expanded our business from the original location in Houston, Texas to 19 locations nationwide, which includes two third-party logistics providers. Our standard practice is to process customers' orders the same day they are received. Our strategically located distribution centers generally allow for ground delivery nationwide within 24 hours of shipment. Orders are delivered through a variety of distribution methods, including less-than-truck-load, truck-load, air or parcel service providers, direct from supplier, cross-dock shipments and customer pick-up. Freight costs are typically borne by our customers. Due to our shipment volume, we have preferred pricing relationships with our contract carriers.
Customers
During 2020, we served over 8,500 customers, shipping approximately 41,000 SKUs to approximately 14,000 customer locations nationwide. No customer represented 10% or more of our 2020 sales.
Suppliers
We obtain products from leading suppliers and believe we have strong relationships with our top suppliers. Starting in mid-2020, we reduced our purchases from one of our top suppliers to a single product line. We source a portion of our products from offshore. While alternative sources are available for the vast majority of our products, we have strategically concentrated our purchases with our top suppliers in order to maximize product quality, delivery dependability, purchasing efficiencies, and vendor rebates. As a result, in 2020, approximately 55% of our purchases came from ten suppliers. We do not believe we are dependent on any one supplier for any of the industrial products that we sell.
Sales
We market our products and related services through an inside sales force situated in our regional offices, a field sales force focused on key geographic markets, and regional sales agencies. By operating under a decentralized structure, region managers are able to adapt quickly to market-specific occurrences, allowing us to compete effectively with local competitors. We believe the knowledge, experience and tenure of our sales force are critical to serving our fragmented and diverse customer and end-user base.
Competition
The industrial products market remains very competitive and fragmented, with several hundred electrical wire and cable, and fastener competitors serving this market. The product offerings and levels of service from the other providers of product with which we compete vary widely at the national, regional or local levels. In addition to the direct competition with other product providers, we also face, on a varying basis, competitors that sell products directly or through multiple distribution channels to end-users or other resellers.
In the markets that we sell our industrial products, competition is primarily based on product line breadth, quality, product availability, service capabilities and price.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had 338 employees. Our sales and marketing staff accounted for 152 employees, including 25 field sales personnel and 94 inside sales and technical support personnel. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Website Access
We maintain an internet website at www.houwire.com. We make available, under the “Investor Relations” tab on our website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports, as well as proxy and information statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Information contained on our website is not part of, and should not be construed as being incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable statutes and regulations affecting environmental issues and our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices.
ITEM 1A.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. As a result of the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
Industry and General Economic Risks
The COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to mitigate or disrupt the pandemic and the related weak, or weakening of, economic conditions have had a negative impact on our business, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact.
We depend on continued demand from our customers to purchase our products and services and on our customers’ ability to pay. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a slowdown of economic activity around the world, disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and we expect these impacts may continue for the foreseeable future. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a particularly adverse impact on the oil and gas industry, which is one of our most important end-markets. A dramatic reduction in oil and gas prices has led to reduced investment in upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas exploration, transportation and production and lessened the demand for our products and services.
Because the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s impact on our operations, financial performance and liquidity, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business, suppliers', and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; general economic uncertainty in the global markets we serve and volatility in financial markets; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. While vaccines have been approved and are being made available, it is unclear how broadly they will be accepted or how quickly they will lead to an end to the pandemic. As a result, it is currently not practicable to predict the precise nature or the extent of any continued adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and on the global economy as a whole. It is also currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. As a result, we expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our operating results in future periods, including by increasing many of the risks described below. However, we are currently unable to provide any assurance as to the magnitude and duration of any such impact.
Downturns in capital spending and cyclicality in the markets we serve have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The majority of our products are used in the construction, maintenance, repair and operation of facilities, plants and projects in the communications, energy, engineering and construction, general manufacturing, infrastructure, oil and gas, marine construction, marine transportation, mining, oilfield services, transportation, utility, wastewater treatment and food and beverage industries. The demand for our products and services depends to a large degree on the capital spending levels of end-users in these markets. Many of these end-users defer capital expenditures or cancel projects during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty. In addition, certain of the markets we serve are cyclical, which affects capital spending by end-users in these industries.
Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices.
Copper, steel, aluminum, nickel and petrochemical products are components of the products we sell. Fluctuations in the costs of these and other commodities have historically affected our operating results. If commodity prices decline, the net realizable value of our existing inventory could be reduced, and our gross profit could be adversely affected. To the extent higher commodity prices result in increases in the costs we pay for our products, we attempt to reflect the increase in the prices we charge our customers. While we historically have been able to pass most of these cost increases on to our customers, to the extent we are unable to do so in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if commodity costs increase, our customers may delay or decrease their purchases of our products.
Our sales are impacted by the level of activity in the oil and gas industry.
We estimate that approximately one-third of our sales directly depend upon the level of capital and operating expenditures in the oil and gas industry, including capital and other expenditures in connection with exploration, drilling, production, gathering, transportation, refining and processing operations. Demand for the products we distribute is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital and other expenditures by, oil and gas companies. A material decline in oil or gas prices, inability to access capital, and consolidation within the industry could all depress levels of exploration, development and production activity and, therefore, could lead to a decrease in our sales due to curtailed capital and MRO expenditures.
Epidemics and other events outside our control, and our inability to successfully mitigate the effects of such events, may harm our business.
All of our facilities are subject to natural or man-made disasters such as floods, fires, acts of terrorism, failures of utilities and epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus COVID-19. If such an event were to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event or our inability to successfully mitigate the effects of the particular event. Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
Our production and supply chains could be severely affected if our employees or the regions in which our facilities or suppliers are located are affected by a significant outbreak of any disease, epidemic or pandemic. For example, a facility could be closed by government authorities for a sustained period of time, some or all of our workforce could be unavailable due to quarantine, fear of catching the disease or other factors, and local, national or international transportation or other infrastructure could be affected, leading to delays or loss of production. In addition, our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks, which could lead to a shortage of inventory or components, or a reduction in our customers’ demand for our products.
An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.
We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of industrial products. Competition is primarily focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, quality, product availability, service capabilities and price. Some of our existing competitors have, and new market entrants may have, greater financial and marketing resources than we do. To the extent existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower our prices, thereby adversely affecting our financial results. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions. Other companies, including our current customers, could seek to compete directly with our private branded products, which could adversely affect our sales of those products and ultimately our financial results. Our existing customers, as well as suppliers, could seek to compete with us by offering services similar to ours, as well as the increasing trend of our suppliers to sell direct to our customer and industry consolidation, which could adversely affect our market share and our financial results. In addition, competitive pressures resulting from economic conditions and the industry trend toward consolidation could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.
Changes to the U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our results of operations.
We import a relatively small but growing percentage of our wire and cable products, as well as a significant portion of our hardware products, from foreign manufacturers. Changes resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could disrupt supply chains on imported goods which could result in limited availability of supply, or cost competitiveness of supply. In addition, recent proposals regarding tariffs have created uncertainty about future trade policies, and any changes in import tariffs or other trade regulations could have a negative impact on our cash flow and require us to change our sourcing and supply chain strategies, adversely affecting our profitability.
Business and Operational Risks
We have risks associated with inventory.
Our business requires us to maintain substantial levels of inventory. We must identify the right mix and quantity of products to keep in our inventory to fulfill customer orders. Failure to do so could adversely affect our sales and earnings. However, if our inventory levels are too high, we are at risk that unexpected changes in circumstances, such as a shift in market demand, drop in prices or loss of a customer, could have a material adverse impact on the net realizable value of our inventory.
We have risks associated with our customers’ access to credit.
Poor credit market conditions may adversely impact the availability of construction and other project financing, upon which many of our customers depend, resulting in project cancellations or delays. Our utility and industrial customers may also face limitations when trying to access the credit markets to fund ongoing operations or capital projects. Credit constraints experienced by our customers may result in lost revenues, reduced gross margins for us and, in some cases, higher than expected bad debt losses.
If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
We rely on customers to purchase our industrial products. The number, size, business strategy and operations of these customers vary widely from market to market. Our success depends heavily on our ability to identify and respond to our customers’ needs.
In 2020, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of our sales. If we were to lose one or more of our large customers, or if one or more of our large customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us, and we were unable to replace the lost sales on similar terms, we could experience a significant loss of revenue and profits. In addition, if one or more of our key customers failed or were
unable to pay, we could experience a write-off or write-down of the related receivables, which could adversely affect our earnings. We participate with national marketing groups and engage in joint promotional sales activities with the members of those groups. Any exclusion of us from, or refusal to allow us to participate in, such national marketing groups could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our results of operations.
An inability to obtain the products that we distribute could result in lost revenues and reduced profits and damage our relationships with customers.
In 2020, we sourced products from approximately 344 suppliers. However, we have adopted a strategy to concentrate our purchases with a small number of suppliers in order to maximize product quality, delivery dependability, purchasing efficiencies and vendor rebates. As a result, in 2020 approximately 55% of our purchases came from ten suppliers. If any of these suppliers changes its sales strategy or decides to terminate its business relationship with us, our sales and earnings could be adversely affected unless and until we were able to establish relationships with suppliers of comparable products. In addition, if we are not able to obtain the products we distribute from either our current suppliers or other competitive sources, we could experience a loss of revenue, reduction in profits and damage to our relationships with our customers. Supply shortages may occur as a result of unanticipated demand or production cutbacks, shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions or other reasons beyond our control. When shortages occur, suppliers often allocate products among their customers, and our allocations might not be adequate to meet our customers' needs.
Loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our ability to operate and grow successfully.
Our success depends to a significant extent on the services of our executive officers, key management and sales personnel. We do not have key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers. We may not be able to retain our executive officers, key personnel or attract additional qualified management and sales personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or our other key management and sales personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could hurt our ability to operate and make it difficult to maintain our market share and to execute our growth strategies.
A change in vendor rebate programs could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.
The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs for products. If suppliers adversely change the terms of some or all of these programs, the changes may lower our gross margins on products we sell and may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Information Technology Risks
If we encounter difficulties with our management information systems, including cyber-attacks, we would experience problems managing our business.
We believe our management information systems are a competitive advantage in maintaining a leadership position in the industrial supply industry. We rely upon our management information systems to manage and replenish inventory, determine pricing, fill and ship orders on a timely basis and coordinate our sales and marketing activities. If we experience problems with our management information systems, we could experience product shortages, diminished inventory control or an increase in accounts receivable. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially. All management information systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. The steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our information technology infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties, and we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyber-attack or information security incident while our workforce works remotely. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
We may be subject to product liability claims that could be costly and time consuming.
We sell industrial products. As a result, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging that these products caused physical injury or injury to property. We rely on product warranties and indemnities from the product manufacturers, as well as insurance that we maintain, to protect us from these claims. However, if manufacturers' warranties and indemnities and our insurance coverage are not available or inadequate to cover every claim, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Credit and Liquidity Risks
We may be adversely affected by the expected discontinuation of LIBOR.
In November 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of U.S. Dollar LIBOR, announced that, following required consultations, (i) it intends to cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR at the end of 2021 and (ii) subject to compliance with applicable regulations, it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023. This announcement is expected to effectively end LIBOR rates beginning June 2023, and, while other alternatives have been proposed, it is unclear which, if any, alternative to LIBOR will be available and widely accepted in major financial markets. Our loan agreement permits both base rate borrowings and LIBOR borrowings. If an alternative to LIBOR is not available and widely accepted after 2023, our ability to borrow at an alternative to the base rate under our loan agreement may be adversely impacted, and the costs associated with any potential future borrowings may increase.

We operate out of 19 distribution centers strategically located throughout the United States with approximately 885,000 square feet of distribution space. We own two facilities in Houston, Texas, including our corporate headquarters. All of the other facilities are leased, except for our two locations operated by third-party logistics providers, which are provided under service agreements. Seventeen of the facilities, in addition to containing inventory for re-sale, house knowledgeable sales staff. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.

Overview
Since our founding 45 years ago, we have grown to be a large provider of industrial products to the U.S. market. Today, we serve over 8,500 customers. Our products are used in MRO activities and related projects, as well as for larger-scale projects in the utility, industrial and infrastructure markets and a diverse range of industrial applications including communications, energy, engineering and construction, general manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, oilfield services, petrochemical, transportation, utility, wastewater treatment and food and beverage. In the past few years, activity in the MRO market has fluctuated, while the level of competition has increased.
Our revenue is driven in part by the level of capital spending within the end-markets we serve. Because many of these end-markets defer capital expenditures during periods of economic downturns, our business has experienced cyclicality. Our revenue has been and will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in capital spending and by our ability to drive demand through our sales and marketing initiatives and the continued development and marketing of our private branded products, such as LifeGuardTM. In 2020, we were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing economic activity and demand for our products, especially in the oil and gas industry, which is our biggest market. Although economic activity and commodity prices have recently begun to show signs of recovery, we cannot yet predict how long the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on our sales and level of demand.
Our direct costs will continue to be influenced significantly by the prices we pay our suppliers to procure the products we distribute to our customers. Changes in these costs may result, for example, from increases or decreases in raw material costs, changes in our relationships with suppliers or changes in vendor rebates. Our operating expenses will continue to be affected by our investment in sales, marketing and customer support personnel and commissions paid to our sales force for revenue and profit generated. Some of our operating expenses are related to our fixed infrastructure, including rent, utilities, information technology, administrative salaries, maintenance, insurance and supplies. To meet our customers’ needs for an extensive product offering and short delivery times, we will need to continue to maintain adequate inventory levels. Our ability to obtain this inventory will depend, in part, on our relationships with suppliers.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
In order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations.
We have identified the following accounting policies as those that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Consistent with industry practices, we require payment from most customers within 30-60 days of the invoice date. We have an estimation procedure, based on historical data and recent changes in the aging of the receivables, that we use to record an allowance. A 20% change in our estimate at December 31,2020 would have resulted in a change in income before income taxes of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Refund Liability
We estimate the gross profit impact of returns and allowances for previously recorded sales. This liability is calculated on historical and statistical returns and allowances data and adjusted as trends in the variables change. A 20% change in our estimate at December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in income before income taxes of approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Vendor Rebates
Some of our arrangements with our vendors entitle us to receive a rebate of a specified amount when we achieve any of a number of measures, generally related to the volume of purchases from the vendor. We account for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales. Throughout the year, we estimate the amount of the rebates earned based on purchases to date relative to the total purchase levels expected to be achieved during the rebate period. We continually revise these estimates to reflect rebates expected to be earned based on actual purchase levels and forecasted purchase volumes for the remainder of the rebate period. A 20% change in our estimate of total rebates earned during 2020 would have resulted in a change in loss before income taxes of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Inventory Reserves
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, or net realizable value. We continually monitor our inventory levels at each of our distribution centers. Our reserve for inventory is based on the age of the inventory, movements of our inventory over the prior twelve months and the experience of our purchasing and sales departments in estimating demand for the product in the succeeding year. Our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, inventory reserves totaled $3.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively. A 20% change in our inventory reserve estimate at December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in income before income taxes of $0.6 million.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill balance was $9.8 million, representing 6.2% of our total assets. In connection with the sale of Southern, we wrote-off $12.5 million of goodwill at December 31, 2020.
We conduct impairment testing for goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently, on an interim basis, when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have declined below its carrying value. Events or circumstances which could indicate a probable impairment include, but are not limited to, financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, reporting unit-specific events, historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment.
We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. We have determined that, in 2020, we had four reporting units for this purpose. At December 31, 2020, we only had three reporting units due to the sale of Southern. Before testing goodwill, we consider whether or not to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether an impairment test is required.
The goodwill impairment test consists of assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test, used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
When performing goodwill impairment testing, the fair values of reporting units are determined based on valuation techniques using the best available information. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows, including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and assumptions about our strategic plans. In developing fair values for our reporting units, we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology, or a combination thereof. The market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group. This analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations, which include financial performance and other quantifiable data, and qualitative considerations, which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance. The most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above non-controlling interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective unit.
The discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit. The discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance. The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue and operating margins, which vary among reporting units. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, represent tradenames and customer relationships acquired in purchase transactions, as well as internal-use software acquired in 2020. At December 31, 2020, our intangible asset balance was $7.4 million, representing 4.7% of our total assets. Tradenames are not being amortized and are treated as indefinite-lived assets. Tradenames are tested for recoverability in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and more frequently, on an interim basis, when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value may have declined below its carrying value. We consider whether or not to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If as a result of our qualitative assessment, we determine that an impairment test is required, or alternatively, if we elect to forego the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative test and, if required, record an impairment for the difference in the discounted cash flows and the carrying value. The results of the interim qualitative test in the first and second quarter of 2020 indicated that certain of the tradenames at Southwest and Vertex were impaired. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative test on Southwest and Vertex which resulted in an impairment charge of $0.2 million in March 2020 and $0.2 million in June 2020.
We assign useful lives to our intangible assets based on the periods over which we expect the assets to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Customer relationships are amortized over 6 to 9 year useful lives and internal software is amortized over 3 year useful life. If events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our definite-lived intangible assets might be impaired, we would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable intangible asset.
When performing quantitative assessments for impairment, we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates under the relief from royalty method, as well as other fair value measures. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material to our results of operations.
Income Taxes
We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and measure them using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially realized. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the ability to realize deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, in determining whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for part or all of the deferred tax assets. In determining the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we place greater weight on recent and objectively verifiable current information, as compared to more forward-looking information that is used in valuing other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have considered taxable income in prior carryback years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
We establish liabilities for estimated tax issues, and the provisions and benefits resulting from changes to those liabilities are included in our annual tax provision along with related interest. We recognize interest on any tax issue as a component of interest expense and any related penalties in other operating expenses.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the United States and the countries in which our offshore suppliers are located. Governments in affected regions have implemented safety precautions which include quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures as they deem necessary. Many organizations and individuals, including our Company and our employees are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and working remotely. We continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations because of the pandemic, including requiring most of our nonessential employees to work remotely. We have maintained a substantial portion of our operational capacity at our warehouses across the continental United States and have instituted several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard our employees.
The rapid development and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. However, the outbreak has had an adverse impact on our business, including reductions in the demand for our products, especially from the oil and gas market. In response, we applied for and received funds under the Paycheck Protection Program and have implemented several cost savings measures which included furloughing employees, reducing headcount, temporary payroll reductions, and other actions to decrease corporate and non-critical expenses. These cost savings measures, which began to have an impact in the latter part of the second quarter, resulted in additional savings for the balance of the year. While we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic, we currently anticipate an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows at least through the first quarter of 2021.
Sales
Our primary source of revenue is the sale of industrial products based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers, as well as billing for freight charges. Revenue is recognized at a point in time once we have determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered (either by customer pickup or through common carrier). Sales incentives earned by customers are accrued in the same month as the shipment is invoiced and are accounted for as a reduction in sales.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of the average cost of the industrial products that we sell. We also incur shipping and handling costs in the normal course of business. Cost of sales also reflects cash discounts for prompt payment to vendors and vendor rebates generally related to annual purchase targets, as well as inventory obsolescence charges.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses include all expenses, excluding freight, incurred to receive, sell and ship product and administer the operations of the Company.
Salaries and Commissions. Salary expense includes the base compensation, and any overtime earned by hourly personnel, for all sales, administrative and warehouse employees and stock compensation expense for options and restricted stock granted to employees. Commission expense is earned by inside sales personnel based on gross profit dollars generated, by field sales personnel from generating sales and meeting various objectives, by sales, national and marketing managers for driving the sales process, by region managers based on the profitability of their branches and by corporate managers based primarily on our profitability and also on other operating metrics.
Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include all payroll taxes, health insurance, travel expenses, public company expenses, advertising, management information system expenses, facility rent and all distribution expenses such as packaging, reels, and repair and maintenance of equipment and facilities.
Depreciation and Amortization. We incur depreciation expense on costs related to capitalized property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to thirty years. We incur amortization expense on leasehold improvements and finance leases over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the related asset and on intangible assets over the estimated life of the asset.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest we incur on our debt.
Results of Operations
The following discussion compares our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
The following table shows, for the periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of sales for the period presented.
Note: Due to rounding, percentages may not add up to total operating expenses, operating income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes or net income (loss).
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Sales
Our sales in 2020 decreased $52.3 million or 15.5% from 2019. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the decline in the oil and gas market, in addition to reduced market demand, both as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate sales for our project business, which targets end markets for Environmental Compliance, Engineering & Construction, Industrials, Utility Power Generation, and Mechanical Wire Rope, decreased 10%, while Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO) sales decreased 17%, as compared to 2019.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased $16.9 million or 21.1% from 2019. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased sales from the decline in the oil and gas market caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of sales) decreased from 23.6% in 2019 to 22.0% in 2020 due to the $0.6 million inventory returned under a one-time agreement with a vendor in the second quarter of 2020, as well as lower rebates from vendors and reduced prompt pay discounts.
Operating Expenses
Note: Due to rounding, numbers may not add up to total operating expenses.
Salaries and Commissions. Salaries and commissions decreased $4.2 million or 11.2% due to expense management necessitated by the decrease in oil and gas prices and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower commissions resulting from the decrease in sales. Reduced full-time headcount, reduced temporary labor and partial-year salary reductions all contributed to the lower salaries and commissions expense.
Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $4.3 million or 13.1% also due to expense management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily from lower travel and entertainment, advertising, office and warehouse supply expenses. In the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a $2.2 million early lease termination liability related to Vertex’s former Massachusetts facility.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to$3.4 million in 2020 from $2.5 million in 2019 primarily due to depreciation on right-of-use assets and amortization of internal-use software acquired in the third quarter of 2020.
Impairment Charge. We recorded non-cash impairment charges in 2020 and 2019 with respect to tradenames at our Southwest and Vertex reporting units. (See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)
Loss on divestiture/HFS classification. In December 2020, we completed the sale of Southern to Southern Rigging Companies, LLC (“Southern Rigging”) for $17.5 million, net of the final working capital adjustment. In January 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell Southwest to Southern Rigging for $5.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, and as such, have classified Southwest as held for sale as of December 31, 2020. In connection with the divestiture of Southern and the classification of Southwest as held for sale, we recorded non-cash losses of $8.7 million in December 2020. (See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased 38.3% from $3.1 million in 2019 to $1.9 million in 2020 due to lower average debt and a decrease in interest rates. Average debt was $72.0 million in 2020 compared to $76.6 million in 2019. The average effective interest rate decreased from 3.8% in 2019 to 2.3% in 2020.
Income Tax
The income tax benefit of $0.6 million in 2020 decreased from the income tax expense of $1.3 million in 2019. The effective income tax rate was 4.8% in 2020 compared to 33.3% in 2019. The effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as nondeductible expenses, share-based compensation and state taxes. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2020 included a benefit of 13.9% for the sale of Southern.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Sales
Our sales in 2019 decreased $18.6 million or 5.2% from 2018. The decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced industrial market demand in oil and gas geographies, reduced demand for fasteners and reduced availability of inventory due to supply chain disruptions resulting from the on-going trade discussions between the United States and China. We estimate sales for our project business, which targets end markets for Environmental Compliance, Engineering & Construction, Industrials, Utility Power Generation, and Mechanical Wire Rope, decreased 5%, while MRO sales decreased 6%, as compared to 2018. When adjusted for fluctuations in commodity prices of approximately 2%, we estimate that MRO and project business sales decreased by 4% and 3%, respectively.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased $5.3 million or 6.2% from 2018. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased sales. Gross margin was near flat at 23.6% in 2019 compared to 23.9% in 2018.
Operating Expenses
Note: Due to rounding, numbers may not add up to total operating expenses.
Salaries and Commissions. Salaries and commissions decreased $0.9 million or 2.4% primarily due to lower commissions resulting from the reduction in sales and gross profit.
Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased $2.3 million or 7.4% primarily due to the $2.2 million early termination liability related to Vertex’s Massachusetts facility lease and additional warehouse distribution expenses resulting from the closure of this facility and two additional warehouse moves in the fourth quarter.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $2.5 million in 2019 from $2.2 million in 2018 primarily due to depreciation on right-of-use assets from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 842.
Impairment Charge. We recorded non-cash impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 with respect to tradenames at our Southwest reporting unit. (See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 21.6% in 2019 from 20.0% in 2018, as operating expenses increased combined with a reduction in sales.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased 5.2% to $3.1 million in 2019 from $2.9 million in 2018 due to higher debt to fund increased working capital and the payment of the early termination liability discussed above. Average debt was $76.6 million in 2019 compared to $76.8 million in 2018. The average effective interest rate increased slightly to 3.8% in 2019 from 3.7% in 2018.
Income Tax
Income tax expense decreased 45.9% to $1.3 million in 2019 from $2.4 million in 2018. The effective income tax rate was 33.3% in 2019 compared to 21.4% in 2018. The effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as nondeductible expenses, share -based compensation and state taxes. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2018 included a benefit of (9.5%) for the release of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.
Impact of Inflation and Commodity Prices
Our results of operations are affected by changes in the inflation rate and commodity prices. Moreover, because copper, steel, aluminum, nickel and petrochemical products are components of the industrial products we sell, fluctuations in the costs of these and other commodities have historically affected our operating results. To the extent commodity prices decline, the net realizable value of our existing inventory could also decline, and our gross profit can be adversely affected because of either reduced selling prices or lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory. If we turn our inventory approximately three times a year, the impact of changes in commodity prices in any particular quarter would primarily affect the results of the succeeding two calendar quarters. If we are unable to pass on to our customers future cost increases due to inflation or rising commodity prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings.
Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current need for cash. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities. Significant factors which could affect liquidity include the following:
• the adequacy of available bank lines of credit;
• cash flows generated from operating activities;
• capital expenditures;
• acquisitions; and
• the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $36.9 million in 2020 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $5.6 million in 2019. We had a net loss of $12.6 million in 2020 compared to net income of $2.6 million in 2019.
Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash provided by operating activities of $33.4 million in 2020. The majority of the change was due to decreases in inventories of $36.3 million, primarily due to efforts to reduce debt, decreases in accounts receivable of $13.6 million due to decreased sales. The main uses of cash were a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of $9.6 million, a decrease in trade accounts payable of $7.2 million as a result of the decrease in inventory, and lease payments of $3.6 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $14.7 million in 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $2.4 million in 2019. The net cash provided by was primarily due to the sale of the Southern reporting unit in December 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities was $55.6 million in 2020 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 million in 2019. Net payments on the revolver of $60.9 million were the primary uses of cash in 2020, offset by the Paycheck Protection Plan loan of $6.2 million received in the second quarter of 2020.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Our net cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million in 2019 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.3 million in 2018. We had net income of $2.6 million in 2019 compared to $8.6 million in 2018.
Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash used in operating activities of $19.3 million in 2019. The majority of the change was due to increased inventories of $20.3 million and lease payments of $6.2 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was the increase of accounts payable of $2.6 million, increase in accrued liabilities of $2.4 million and decrease in accounts receivable of $2.6 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million in 2019 compared to $1.5 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to expenditures for the computer system upgrade and conversion.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $10.7 million in 2019 compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.5 million in 2018. Net borrowings under our revolver of $12.2 million and the purchase of treasury stock of $1.2 million were the main components of financing activities in 2019.
Indebtedness
Our principal source of liquidity at December 31, 2020 was working capital of $91.4 million compared to $138.5 million at December 31, 2019. We also had available borrowing capacity of approximately $47.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 22.8 million at December 31, 2019 under our loan agreement.
We believe that we will have adequate availability of capital to fund our present operations, meet our commitments on our existing debt, and fund anticipated growth over the next twelve months, including expansion in existing and targeted market areas. We continually seek potential acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition candidates. If suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing, we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms. Additionally, based on market conditions, we may decide to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock to raise funds.
Loan and Security Agreement
HWC Wire & Cable Company, Vertex, and Bank of America, N.A., as agent and lender, are parties to the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), as amended on December 10, 2019. The Loan Agreement provides a $115 million revolving credit facility and expires on March 12, 2024. Under certain circumstances we may request an increase in the commitment by an additional $50 million. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate plus 100 to 150 basis points based on availability, if a LIBOR loan, or at a fluctuating rate equal to the greatest of the agent’s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR for a 30-day interest period plus 150 basis points, if a base rate loan. The unused commitment fee is 25 basis points. Availability under the Loan Agreement is limited to a borrowing base equal to 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable, plus the lesser of 70% of the value of eligible inventory or 90% of the net orderly liquidation value percentage of the value of eligible inventory, in each case less certain reserves. The Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of our property, other than real estate.
Covenants in the Loan Agreement require us to maintain a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, unless certain availability levels exist. Repaid amounts can be re-borrowed subject to the borrowing base. As of December 31, 2020, we met the availability-based covenant.
On May 4, 2020, we received a $6.2 million Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan from Bank of America (“Lender”), funded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), pursuant to a Promissory Note issued by the Company to Lender. We used the funds to pay payroll related expenses as well as rent expenses, as allowed by the terms of the loan. We have applied for loan forgiveness and believe we will achieve 90-95% forgiveness. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven will be due on May 4, 2022.
Capital Expenditures
We made capital expenditures of $1.1 million, $2.4 million and $1.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Financial Derivatives
We have no financial derivatives.
Climate Risk
Our operations are subject to inclement weather conditions, which could potentially be related to climate change, including hurricanes, earthquakes and abnormal weather events. Our previous experience from these events has had a minimal effect on our operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee
Houston Wire & Cable Company
Houston, Texas
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Houston Wire & Cable Company (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Tradename Impairment Assessment
The Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets consist of tradenames with a balance of approximately $2.1 million at December 31, 2020. As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the tradenames are carried at acquisition fair value net of any impairment charges recognized. The Company tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that they may be impaired. To estimate the fair value of the tradenames, the Company utilizes the relief from royalty method.
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of the tradenames is a critical audit matter was due to the subjective nature of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the tradenames. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as forecasted revenue growth rates, terminal period revenue growth rate, discount rate and royalty rate, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, including uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s tradenames, with the support of our internal valuation specialists, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodology and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We also compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends.
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Houston Wire & Cable Company (the “Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, provides industrial products to the U.S. market through nineteen locations in thirteen states throughout the United States. In December 2020, the Company completed the sale of Southern Wire (“Southern”) to Southern Rigging Companies, LLC (“Southern Rigging”) for $17.5 million, net of the final working capital adjustment, and was negotiating an agreement for the sale of substantially all of the assets of Southwest Wire Rope (“Southwest”) to Southern Rigging. Accordingly, Southwest is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020. (See Note 13) The Company has no other business activity.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and have been prepared following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates are those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the refund liability, the inventory obsolescence reserve, vendor rebates, the realization of deferred tax assets and the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used for the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists primarily of receivables from customers, less an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million at December 31, 2020 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2019. Consistent with industry practices, the Company requires payment frommost customers within 30-60 days of the invoice date. The Company has an estimation procedure, based on historical data and recent changes in the aging of its receivables, that it uses to record an allowance. The Company reviews delinquent accounts, typically over 90 days, and writes-off balances, as appropriate, after collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company has no contractual repurchase arrangements with its customers. Credit losses have been within management’s expectations.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, and net realizable value and consist primarily of goods purchased for resale, less a reserve for obsolescence and unusable items and unamortized vendor rebates. The reserve for inventory is based upon a number of factors, including the experience of the purchasing and sales departments, age of the inventory, new product offerings, and other factors. The reserve for inventory may periodically require adjustment as the factors identified above change.
Vendor Rebates
Under many of the Company’s arrangements with its vendors, the Company receives a rebate of a specified amount of consideration, payable when the Company achieves any of a number of measures, generally related to the volume level of purchases from the vendors. The Company accounts for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendors’ products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until it sells the products, at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Throughout the year, the Company estimates the amount of the rebates earned based on purchases to date relative to the total purchase levels expected to be achieved during the rebate period. At year end, the Company recalculates the rebates earned based on actual purchases made.
Property and Equipment
The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings
25 to 30 years
Machinery and equipment
3 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their estimated life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Total depreciation expense was approximately $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items. At December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance was $9.8 million, representing 6.3% of the Company’s total assets.
The Company conducts impairment testing for goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and more frequently, on an interim basis, when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have declined below its carrying value. Events or circumstances which could indicate a probable impairment include, but are not limited to, financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, reporting unit-specific events, historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment.
The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. The Company determined that, in 2020, it had four reporting units for this purpose. At December 31, 2020, the Company only had three reporting units due to the sale of Southern. Before testing goodwill, the Company considers whether or not to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether an impairment test is required. If as a result of the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that an impairment test is required, or alternatively, if the Company elects to forego the qualitative assessment, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and records an impairment to goodwill to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. See Note 4 for more details.
Intangibles
Intangible assets, consist of customer relationships and tradenames from the acquisition of Southwest and Southern in 2010 and the acquisition of Vertex in 2016, as well as internal-use software acquired in 2020. The Southern intangible assets were written off at December 31, 2020 in connection with the sale. The customer relationships and internal-use software are amortized over 9 and 3 year useful lives, respectively. If events or circumstances were to indicate that any of the Company’s definite-lived intangible assets might be impaired, the Company would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable intangible asset. If the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value, then the intangible assets would be written down to their fair value. Tradenames have an indefinite life and are not being amortized and are tested for impairment on an annual basis. See Note 4 for more details.
Leases
At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company determines the lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate which approximates to a collateralized rate at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments that are reasonably certain. See Note 7 for more details.
Self Insurance
The Company retains certain self-insurance risks for health benefits. The Company limits its exposure to these self-insurance risks by maintaining excess and aggregate liability coverage. Self-insurance reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimates are based on information provided to the Company by its claims administrators.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates in a single operating and reportable segment, sales of industrial products, including electrical and mechanical wire and cable, industrial fasteners, hardware and related services to the U.S. market. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes operational and resource decisions based on company-wide sales and margin performance compared to the established strategic goals of the Company.
Revenue Recognition, Returns & Allowances
The Company’s primary source of revenue is the sale of industrial products based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the product is shipped, or delivered (either by customer pickup or through common carrier). It is not normal Company practice to grant extended payment terms. Revenue is recognized net of any sales taxes collected, which are subsequently remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. The Company treats its transportation costs (shipping and handling) as fulfillment costs and not as a separate performance obligation. These transportation costs are recorded in cost of sales.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for products sold. Revenue is recorded at the transaction price net of estimates of variable consideration, which may include product returns, trade discounts and allowances. The Company accrues for variable consideration using the expected value method. Estimates of variable consideration are included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.
Customers are permitted to return product only on a case-by-case basis. Product exchanges are handled as a credit, with any replacement item being re-invoiced to the customer. Customer returns are recorded as a refund liability, included in accrued and other liabilities, with a corresponding reduction to sales. The Company estimates the gross profit impact of returns and allowances for previously recorded sales. This liability is calculated on historical and statistical returns and allowances data and adjusted as trends in the variables change. The Company has no installation obligations.
The Company may offer sales incentives, which are accrued monthly as an adjustment to sales.
Shipping and Handling
The Company incurs shipping and handling costs in the normal course of business. Freight amounts invoiced to customers are included as sales, and freight charges are included as a component of cost of sales.
Credit Risk
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s sales in 2020, 2019 or 2018. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral.
Financial Instruments
The carrying values of accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value, due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted stock awards, units and cash awards are valued at the closing price of the Company’s stock on the grant date and are granted under the Company’s 2017 Stock Plan. Stock options issued under the Company’s now-expired 2006 Stock Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. The Company’s stock-based compensation expense is included in salaries and commissions expense for employees and in other operating expenses for non-employee directors in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company receives a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises in the period in which the options are exercised, generally for the excess of the market price on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the options. The Company reports excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as operating cash flows. Excess tax benefits result when a deduction reported for tax return purposes for an award of equity instruments exceeds the cumulative compensation cost for the instruments recognized for financial reporting purposes.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, the Company uses its current financial position, results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies to determine whether a valuation allowance is required.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than SEC issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. The following are those recent ASUs that were recently adopted by the Company.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” The amendments in this update eliminate, add and modify certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB’s disclosure framework project. The Company adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2020, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40); Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” The amendments in this update require implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements (i.e., hosting arrangements) to be capitalized under the same premises of authoritative guidance for internal-use software, and deferred over the non-cancellable term of the cloud computing arrangement plus any option renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised by the customer or for which the exercise is controlled by the service provider. The Company adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2020, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.” This ASU, among other narrow-scope improvements, clarifies guidance around how to report expected recoveries. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on assets purchased with credit deterioration. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recording negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. The effective date and transition methodology are the same as in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The FASB deferred the effective dates of this ASU for smaller reporting companies (“SRC”) to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company qualifies as a SRC and expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2023.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether certain exceptions apply in a given period. This ASU also improves financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: a) Franchise taxes that are partially based on income; b) Transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; c) Separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and d) Enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” The amendments in the ASU provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The provisions of the new guidance were effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022 with the option to apply the guidance at any point during that time period. The Company currently has a debt agreement that references LIBOR and will apply the new guidance as this agreement is modified to reference other rates.
2. Earnings (loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share include the dilutive effects of options and unvested restricted stock awards and units.
The following reconciles the denominator used in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share:
Stock awards to purchase 843,336, 369,325 and 298,406 shares of common stock were not included in the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the first quarter of 2018, the Company calculated earnings per share using the “two-class” method, whereby unvested share-based payment awards that contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents were considered “participating securities”, and therefore, these participating securities were treated as a separate class in computing earnings per share.

(1)This includes finance leases. See Note 7 for more details.
Intangible assets
As of December 31, 2020, accumulated amortization on the remaining acquired/purchased intangible assets was $3.4 million, and amortization expense was $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Future amortization expense to be recognized on the remaining acquired/purchased intangible assets is expected to be as follows:
Goodwill
(1)The balance is net of $12.6 million of accumulated impairment losses, of which none were recorded in 2020 or 2019.
Accrued and Other Current Liabilities
(1)This amount represents prepayments by customers for inventory. As the customer requests their inventory, the Company ships the material, reduce the prepayment and recognize the revenue.
4.Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that it might be impaired. During the first and second quarter of 2020, the Company’s market capitalization declined significantly, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions due in large part to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has contributed to a decline in demand for the Company’s products, a decline in overall financial performance, partially due to the decline in oil prices, and a deterioration of industry and market conditions. Based on these events, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of certain of its reporting units were less than their carrying values. Therefore, the Company performed interim goodwill impairment tests in both the first and second quarter.
Goodwill impairment is evaluated at each reporting unit that has goodwill; the Southern and Vertex reporting units as of December 31, 2019 and the Vertex reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Company determined that the fair values of these two reporting units, as well as certain of the Company’s indefinite lived intangibles, exceeded their respective carrying values. The goodwill balance of Vertex at December 31, 2020 was $9.8 million, and due to its negative carrying value, no goodwill impairment was recorded.
During June 2020, the Company determined the fair value of its Vertex reporting unit’s tradenames was below its carrying value, and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $0.1 million. The Company also determined the fair value of its Southwest reporting unit’s tradenames was below its carrying value, and as a result, recorded an impairment charge of $0.1 million in June 2020 and $0.2 million in March 2020.
As part of the divestiture of the Southern reporting unit, the Company wrote-off its $12.5 million goodwill balance and as part of the HFS classification of the Southwest reporting unit, wrote-off its $1.0 million tradenames balance at December 31, 2020.
A qualitative assessment was performed as of October 1, 2019 for the Southern, Southwest and Vertex reporting units. The results of the test indicated that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values except for certain of the tradenames of the Southwest reporting unit for which a quantitative test was necessary and an impairment charge of $0.1 million was recorded for 2019.
The Company is still anticipating growth in the business acquired in Vertex reporting unit. If this projected growth is not achieved and or there are future reductions in our market capitalization or market multiples, further goodwill and intangible assets impairments may result.
5.Debt
On March 12, 2019 and December 10, 2019, the Company, as guarantor, HWC Wire & Cable Company and Vertex, as borrowers, and Bank of America, N.A., as agent and lender, entered into the Second and Third Amendments, respectively, to the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (such agreement, as so amended, the “Loan Agreement”). The Second Amendment extended the expiration date until March 12, 2024 and the Third Amendment increased the revolving credit facility to $115 million . Under certain circumstances, the Company may request an increase in the commitment by an additional $50 million.
Portions of the loan may be converted to LIBOR loans in minimum amounts of $1.0 million and integral multiples of $0.1 million. LIBOR loans bear interest at the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate plus 100 to 150 basis points based on availability, and loans not converted to LIBOR loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the greatest of the agent’s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or 30-day LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The unused commitment fee is 25 basis points.
Availability under the Loan Agreement is limited to a borrowing base equal to 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable, plus the lesser of 70% of the value of eligible inventory or 90% of the net orderly liquidation value percentage of the value of eligible inventory, in each case less certain reserves. The Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of the property of the Company, other than real estate.
The Loan Agreement includes, among other things, covenants that require the Company to maintain a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, unless certain availability levels exist. Additionally, the Loan Agreement allows for the unlimited payment of dividends and repurchases of stock, subject to the absence of events of default and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum level of availability. The Loan Agreement contains certain provisions that may cause the debt to be classified as a current liability, in accordance with GAAP, if availability falls below certain thresholds, even though the ultimate maturity date under the Loan Agreement remains March 12, 2024. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the availability-based covenant governing its indebtedness.
The Company’s borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $28.8 million and $83.5 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding borrowings were 1.9% and 3.4% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $47.5 million under the terms of the Loan Agreement. The Company paid $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 for the unused facility.
The carrying amount of long term debt approximates fair value as it bears interest at variable rates. The fair value is a Level 2 measurement as defined in ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement.”
On May 4, 2020, the Company received a $6.2 million Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan from Bank of America (“Lender”), funded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), pursuant to a Promissory Note issued by the Company to Lender. The Company used the funds to pay its payroll related expenses as well as rent expenses, as allowed by the terms of the loan. The Company has applied for loan forgiveness and expects to achieve 90-95% forgiveness. The forgiveness amount will be equal to the amount that the Company used for the approved expenses: a minimum of 60% on payroll related expenses and up to 40% on non-payroll expenses. Any amount of the loan that is not forgiven will be due two years from the funding date of May 4, 2020 to repay the balance of the PPP loan. No principal or interest payments will be due prior to the end of the six-month deferment period and the interest rate on the balance of the loan will not exceed 1.0% per annum.
Principal repayment obligations for succeeding fiscal years are as follows:
(1)The Company has applied for loan forgiveness and believes that it will achieve 90-95% forgiveness, or approximately $5.6-$5.9 million.
6.Income Taxes
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of:
A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate on income before taxes is as follows:
Significant components of the Company’s deferred taxes were as follows:
The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits recorded at December 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company recognizes interest on any tax issue as a component of interest expense and any related penalties in other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded no provision for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years 2016 through 2020 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
7.Leases
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” and the series of related ASUs that followed (collectively referred to as “Topic 842”). The most significant changes under the new guidance include clarification of the definition of a lease, and the requirements for lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for all qualifying leases with terms longer than twelve months in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, under Topic 842, additional disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The Company elected the practical expedient available under ASU 2018-11 “Leases: Targeted Improvements,” which allows the Company to apply the transition provision for Topic 842 at the Company’s adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented in the Company’s financial statements. Therefore, the Company recognized and measured leases existing at January 1, 2019 but without retrospective application. The Company also elected all other available practical expedients except the hindsight practical expedient.
In electing the practical expedients, the Company utilized the transition practical expedient package whereby the Company did not reassess (i) whether any of the Company’s expired or existing contracts contain a lease, (ii) the classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
The impact of Topic 842 on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while the Company’s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. The Company’s finance leases were immaterial prior to the adoption of Topic 842, and no change was made to the classification of these leases. As a result of the adoption of Topic 842, beginning retained earnings was impacted by $0.1 million and there was no impact to the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company leases property including warehouse space, offices, vehicles and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. As part of the transition to the new standard, the Company reviewed agreements with suppliers, vendors, customers, and other outside parties to determine if any agreements met the definition of an embedded lease. This is based on the nature of the contracts reviewed, and various factors, including identified assets included in the agreement to which the Company has exclusive rights of control as described by Topic 842. The Company concluded that these are not material agreements with parties that would constitute an embedded lease. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Beginning January 1, 2019, operating ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Operating leases in effect prior to January 1, 2019 were recognized at the present value of the remaining lease payments over the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019. The Company is required to determine a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of lease payments. If the rate is not included in the lease or cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental secured borrowing rate based on lease term information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company recognizes lease components and non-lease components together and not as separate parts of a lease for all leases. The Company will exercise this practical expedient in the future by asset class.
Rent expense was approximately $3.7 million in 2018.
The value of the net assets and liabilities generated by the leasing activity of the Company as lessee as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows:
(1)Operating lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $4.3 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)Financing lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $1.2 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The future minimum lease payments for finance and operating lease liabilities of the Company as lessee as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:
The weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates of the leases held by the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
The cash outflows of the leasing activity of the Company as lessee for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded non-cash ROU financing lease assets and corresponding financing lease obligations totaling $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, primarily related to warehouse machinery and IT infrastructure lease agreements.
Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company modified certain terms of the lease agreement with the landlord of Vertex’s Massachusetts facility, including early termination of the lease on November 30, 2019 and Vertex subleasing a portion of the space until the end of November. In connection with the modification, the Company recognized expense related to the early termination of approximately $2.2 million in 2019.
8.Stockholders’ Equity
On March 7, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $25 million of its outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, trading activity, business conditions and other factors. Shares of stock purchased under the program are held as treasury shares and may be used to satisfy the exercise of options, issuance of restricted stock, to fund acquisitions or for other uses as authorized by the Board of Directors. In November 2016, the Board of Directors suspended purchases under the stock repurchase program. In August 2019, the plan was reactivated and during 2019, the Company purchased an aggregate of 235,500 shares for a total cost of $1.1 million. There were no purchases under the program in 2020.
Under the terms of the 2017 Stock Plan, the Company acquired 25,201 shares and 26,731 shares that were surrendered by the holders to pay withholding taxes in 2020 and 2019, respectively. (See Note 10)
The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend from August 2007 until August 2016. The Company has not paid a cash dividend since 2016.
The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the particular preferences, rights, qualifications and restrictions of each series of preferred stock. In connection with the adoption of a now terminated stockholder rights plan, the Board of Directors designated 100,000 shares as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.
9.Retirement-related Benefits
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company maintains a combination profit-sharing plan and salary deferral plan for the benefit of its employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees who are eligible to participate in the plan can contribute a percentage of their base compensation, up to the maximum percentage allowable not to exceed the limits of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(k), 404, and 415, subject to the IRS-imposed dollar limit. Employee contributions are invested in certain equity and fixed-income securities, based on employee elections. From January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2020, the Company matched 100% of the first 1% of the employee’s contribution. The Company’s match for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million for each year.
Defined Benefit Plan
The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for those current and former employees of Vertex who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Effective November 30, 2019, there are no active employees in the plan as the plan was frozen with the closure of Vertex’s Massachusetts facility. The benefit provisions to participants of the defined benefit plan were calculated based on the number of years of service and an annual negotiated plan benefit per year of service. Annual compensation (or future compensation increases) is not used in calculating the benefit or future plan contributions. It is the Company’s policy to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws, which currently approximate the benefit payments made each year. A total contribution of less than $0.1 million was made during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of November 30, 2019, the defined benefit plan is inactive, with no additional incremental benefits being accrued.
The current projected benefit obligation was $0.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation was 2.0% and 3.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The fair value of the assets of the defined benefit plan was $0.8 million and $1.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The plan assets are all classified as Level 1 and as such have readily observable prices and therefore a reliable fair market value.
10.Incentive Plans
The Houston Wire & Cable Company 2017 Stock Plan (the “2017 Plan”) as amended in 2019, provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs) to employees and directors up to a total of 2,500,000 shares. Shares issuable under the 2017 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. If any award granted under the 2017 Plan expires, terminates or is forfeited or cancelled for any reason, the shares subject to the award will again be available for issuance. Any shares subject to an award that are delivered to the Company or withheld by the Company on behalf of a participant as payment for the award (including the exercise price of a stock option or SAR) or as payment for any withholding taxes due in connection with the award, or that are purchased by the Company with proceeds received from a stock option exercise, will not again be available for issuance. The 2017 Plan’s purpose is to attract and retain outstanding individuals as employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and to provide them with additional incentive to expand and improve the Company's profits by giving them the opportunity to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the Company.
The 2017 Plan succeeded the Company’s 2006 Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which expired on May 1, 2017. The types of equity awards previously authorized under the 2006 Plan did not significantly differ from those permitted under the 2017 Plan.
Stock Option Awards
The Company may grant options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors of the Company under the 2006 Plan and 2017 Plan at no less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. These options are granted for a term not exceeding ten years and may be forfeited in the event the employee or director terminates his or her employment or relationship with the Company. Options granted to employees generally vest over three to five years, and options granted to directors generally vest one year after the date of grant. Shares issued to satisfy the exercise of options may be newly issued shares or treasury shares. Each plan contains anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization. Compensation cost for options granted is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the term of the option.
The fair value of each option awarded is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. There were no options granted in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
All granted stock options have vested, with the last grant having an expiration date of December 20, 2021. The following summarizes stock option activity and related information: Schedule of stock option activity
There was no excess tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
There were no options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. There is no intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2020 as the closing stock price at the end of 2020 creates a negative intrinsic value.
The total grant-date fair value of options vested during 2020 and 2019 was $0, as all the options vested as of December 31, 2018.
Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Cash Awards
As a result of the approval of the 2017 Plan by the stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting, all cash/liability awards granted prior to stockholder approval of the 2017 Plan were reclassified to restricted stock units (equity) effective May 8, 2018. The total liability reclassified to additional paid-in-capital was $0.4 million. This modification resulted in an increase in total fair value of $0.1 million, recognized over the terms of the grants, which range from 1 to 5 years.
On November 3, 2020, the Board of Directors granted to the Company’s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer 55,000 voting shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan. The shares vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, as long as he is then employed by the Company. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
On June 26, 2020, the Board of Directors granted 10,000 restricted stock units to the newly named executive chairman of the board. The award vests in two equal installments on June 26, 2021 and June 26, 2022. The award entitles the executive chairman of the board to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of vested restricted stock units, together with dividend equivalents from the date of grant, at such time as his service on the board terminates for any reason.
On December 3, 2019, the Board of Directors granted to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer 78,125 voting shares of restricted stock and to the former Chief Financial Officer, 19,531 voting shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan. The former Chief Financial Officer’s shares were forfeited when he left the Company in July 2020. The President and Chief Executive Officer’s shares vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, in each case as long he is then employed by the Company. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
Also, on December 3, 2019, the Board of Directors granted 250,000 shares of restricted stock to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and 125,000 shares of restricted stock to the former Chief Financial Officer. The former Chief Financial Officer’s shares were forfeited when he left the Company in July 2020. The President and Chief Executive Officer’s grant vests if there is a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the 2017 Plan) on or before December 2, 2024, as long as he remains in continuous employment with the Company until the Change in Control or if he is terminated by the Company without cause within one year before the Change in Control. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
The Board of Directors also granted 39,719 voting shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan to members of management in December 2019. The shares vest in one-third increments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant, in each case as long as the recipient is then employed by the Company. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares or units vest.
Following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 7, 2019, the Company granted restricted stock units with a grant date value of $60,000 to each nonemployee director who was elected, for an aggregate of 58,920 restricted stock units. Each award of restricted stock units vested at the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each non-employee director is entitled to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of vested restricted stock units, together with dividend equivalents from the date of grant, at such time as the director’s service on the board terminates for any reason.
On March 12, 2019, the Board of Directors granted 52,910 performance stock units to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and 13,228 performance stock units to the former Chief Financial Officer. The former Chief Financial Officer’s units were forfeited when he left the Company in July 2020. The President and Chief Executive Officer’s performance stock units vests on December 31, 2021, based on and subject to the Company’s achievement of cumulative EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) and stock price performance goals over a three-year period, as long as he is then employed by the Company, and upon vesting will be settled in shares of our common stock. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
Restricted common shares and restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the quoted price of the common stock. Such value is recognized as compensation expense over the corresponding vesting period which ranges from one to five years, based on the number of awards that vest.
The following summarizes restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Schedule of restricted stock activity
Total stock-based compensation cost was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total income tax benefit recognized for equity awards stock-based compensation arrangements was $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested, stock-based compensation arrangements. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 17 months. There are 1,631,123 shares available for future grants under the 2017 Plan at December 31, 2020.
11.Commitments and Contingencies
The Company had aggregate purchase commitments for fixed inventory quantities of approximately $32.0 million at December 31, 2020.
The Company had outstanding under the Loan Agreement letters of credit totaling $0.7 million to certain vendors as of December 31, 2020.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits that are brought against us in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that we expect, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results from operations.
12.Select Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)
The following table presents the Company’s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

(1)This includes the loss on divestitures/HFS classification of $8,727.
13.Divestitures
Divestiture of Southern and Southwest reporting units
On December 2, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to dispose of our Southern reporting unit. Upon the closing of this transaction on December 31, 2020, the Company received $17.5 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments of $1.5 million. An additional $1.0 million is due from escrow and will be released one year following the close of the transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on divestiture of approximately $2.0 million related to the transaction in its consolidated statements of income. The loss recognized included selling costs of $0.3 million. The Company also recorded a tax benefit of $15.4 million related to this transaction.
In addition, in January 2021 the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the Southwest reporting unit, other than accounts receivable. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company will receive approximately $5.0 million in cash, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. As of December 31, 2020, the Southwest reporting unit was classified as held for sale in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and measured at the expected sales price less estimated selling costs. The Company incurred a loss on classification of the assets held for sale of $6.7 million, which includes $0.1 million of selling costs incurred prior to year-end, and the Company ceased depreciation of these properties upon their classification as held for sale.
The following is a summary of net assets and net liabilities related to Southwest as of December 31, 2020, that were classified as held for sale: Schedule of net assets and net liabilities classified as held for sale
The Company evaluated the divestitures of the Southern and Southwest reporting units individually and in the aggregate and determined that they did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operations or financial results and did not qualify as a significant component of the Company. As a result, the divestitures were not reported as discontinued operations.
14.
Subsequent Events
Completion of Sale of Southwest
On March 12, 2021, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets, other than accounts receivable of approximately $2.9 million, of its Southwest reporting unit and received $3.4 million in cash, subject to final working capital adjustments. An additional $0.8 million is due from escrow and will be released no later than one year following the close of the transaction.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On March 25, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Omni Cable, LLC (“OmniCable”) and a subsidiary of OmniCable pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of OmniCable. Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger each share of the Company’s common stock will be converted into the right to receive $5.30 in cash, without interest. In addition, each of the 300,461 stock-based equity awards outstanding under the Company’s stock and deferred compensation plans will be cancelled in exchange for $5.30. No consideration will be paid for stock options, all of which have exercise prices above the merger price.
The merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, among other things: (1) the adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock; (2) the absence of certain legal impediments preventing the completion of the merger; (3) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and the compliance of the parties with their respective covenants, subject to customary qualifications, including with respect to materiality; and (4) conditions relating to the Company’s tangible net book value and indebtedness. The Company expects the merger to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15a-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.
Design and Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we included a report of management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established by Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (“COSO Framework”). The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting included testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls. In management’s opinion, the Company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the COSO Framework.

Overview
Airbnb is a community based on connection and belonging-a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to 4 million hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. Airbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive.
Hosting is at the Center
Airbnb’s hosts are the foundation of our community and business. Stays are made possible by hosts. It is their individuality that makes Airbnb unique. From schoolteachers to artists, our hosts span more than 220 countries and regions and approximately 100,000 cities. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of the United States.
Airbnb enables hosts to provide guests access to a vast world of unique homes and experiences that were previously inaccessible, or even undiscovered. The role of the host is about more than opening their door. A great host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit and the people who live there.
Our community of hosts started by sharing their spare bedrooms on Airbnb in a few large cities. Soon, hosts listed entire homes, cabins, treehouses, boats, castles, and luxury villas - practically any space that you could think of - in big cities, small towns, and rural communities in nearly every corner of the world. Our hosts generally fall into two categories: individual and professional. Individual hosts are those who activate their listings directly on Airbnb through our website or mobile apps. Individual hosts are the core of our host community. They come from all walks of life and list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb. Professional hosts are often those who run property management or hospitality businesses and generally use application programming interfaces to list their properties on our platform. These hosts expand the types of listings available to our guests.
Once there were millions of homes on Airbnb, we recognized that hosts could share not only their homes but also their interests and talents. From exploring graffiti art in New York City to finding hidden jazz clubs in London, Airbnb Experiences offer authentic activities in over 1,000 cities around the world.
We believe that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting provides. There are many more ways people will want to connect with each other and the world around them, and so we will continue to design and enable new ways to host. No matter what form it takes, hosting will be at the center of Airbnb.
Host Endowment Fund
In October 2020, we established a Host Endowment Fund that is designed to allow hosts to share in the success of our business. The Host Endowment Fund was funded with 9.2 million shares of our Class H common stock and is intended to be a long-term investment in the future of the host community, to be shaped by hosts for hosts. The goal of the Host Endowment Fund is to support and benefit the host community through a variety of potential programs, initiatives, and grants. We want hosts to share in our success, not merely for a single moment in time, but for as long as Airbnb exists in the world.
In December 2020, we introduced 17 hosts from 14 countries and five continents as the first members of the Host Advisory Board for 2021. The Host Advisory Board is intended to give voices to hosts to help present ideas, inform Airbnb policies, and shape investments in the host community from the Host Endowment Fund.
Guests are Members of Our Community
Our hosts have welcomed hundreds of millions of guest arrivals through Airbnb. Guest arrivals represent an individual and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period. Our guests are not transactions - they are engaged, contributing members of our community. From young people to retirees, our guests come from a range of cultures and places. They seek everything from budget stays to luxury accommodations in large cities to remote villages. What they often have in common is a curiosity about the world and open-mindedness to other people and cultures. While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travelers: as of December 31, 2020, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34.
Once they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, many return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb to others who then join themselves. This demand encourages new hosts to join, which in turn attracts even more guests. It is a virtuous cycle - guests attract hosts, and hosts attract guests.
A Resilient Model
In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb’s business declined significantly. But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and
yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling.
And just as when Airbnb started during the Great Recession of 2008, we believe that people will continue to turn to hosting to earn extra income. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict COVID-19’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our recent operating and financial results and is continuing to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results. However, we believe that as the world recovers from this pandemic, Airbnb will be a vital source of economic empowerment for millions of people.
For almost a year, many travelers have avoided traveling long distance because of COVID-19 concerns, quarantines, and travel restrictions. We expect the early part of 2021 will continue to be characterized by lower demand for long distance travel and overall depressed bookings compared to 2019. While the outlook for the entire year is unclear, we believe there may be opportunity for travel recovery as the rate of vaccinations increases and quarantine requirements and travel restrictions are lifted. According to a survey conducted by us in December 2020, 54% of the respondents said they have either already booked, are currently planning on traveling, or expect to travel in 2021. This includes 57% of 18- to 29-year-olds, and 60% of 30- to 49-year-olds. We are preparing for when travel rebounds as there will be a collective desire for two things: travel and human connection.
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy
Our strategy is to continue to invest in our key strengths:
•Unlock more hosting. In order to have enough selection for guests booking on our platform, we will continue to invest in growing the size and quality of our host community. We plan to attract more hosts globally and expand new use cases such as long-term stays. We will support emerging travel trends, such as local travel and remote working, and design new ways to host. Finally, we will continue to increase the support we provide our hosts to deliver high-quality stays and experiences for guests. We plan to design new tools and services and to offer comprehensive host education, partnering with hosts to teach the art and science of great hosting. We believe that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting can provide.
•Grow and engage our guest community. We intend to attract new guests to Airbnb and convert more of them into brand advocates. We will continue to focus on engaging our existing guests to return to book and to use Airbnb with more frequency. With new behaviors evolving during the COVID-19 pandemic, we imagine the way that people approach work, living, and travel will fundamentally change. We believe there will be opportunities to create products based on these new behaviors and attract more guests to our platform. Finally, we plan to develop new ways for our guests to connect with each other and to contribute back to Airbnb.
•Invest in our brand. We intend to invest more deeply in our brand to educate new hosts and guests on the benefits of Airbnb and the uniqueness of our offering. We also intend to leverage our brand by creating a cohesive and integrated marketing strategy punctuated by product launches that introduce new features to our community and prospective hosts and guests.
•Expand our global network. We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world. We will make Airbnb more accessible in more places by further localizing our product, and we will partner with communities to update laws and regulations for short-term rentals to allow more hosts to participate. As we attract more hosts, even more guests are likely to come to Airbnb, attracting even more hosts.
•Innovate on our platform. We will innovate both the online and in-person experiences for our hosts and our guests. Our innovation will be focused on improving our host and guest experience, making Airbnb more accessible and appealing for new hosts and guests and driving increased engagement and loyalty with our existing community.
•Design new products and offerings. We will design new opportunities for connection. As the world continues to change, we will continue to bring together new technologies with our design expertise to expand possibilities for our hosts and offer new
experiences for our guests. We will increase the capabilities of our website and mobile apps while bringing an innovative approach to designing host and guest interfaces in our products.
Our Strategy for Adapting to COVID-19
Many of our hosts have been severely impacted by COVID-19, with increased cancellations and a drop in bookings. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on host earnings and our business, our host and active listing counts were stable for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings, defined as accommodations and experiences that are viewable on a certain date on our platform (excluding Hotel Tonight), as of a certain date and we consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an “active listing” if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb (excluding Hotel Tonight). In addition, many of our guests have been unable to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, starting in the second half of 2020, demand from guests grew year-over-year for stays less than 50 miles and within 50-300 miles from guest origin and long-term stays, or stays on our platform of at least 28 nights. We believe the way people travel will fundamentally change. Since the pandemic started, we have seen guests turn to Airbnb for new use cases, such as living closer to family, living nomadically, working remotely, and remote schooling.
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced that travel is an enduring human desire, even in the face of challenges. People have increasingly sought travel options closer to home during COVID-19, and Airbnb’s offerings are well suited to adapt to this changing dynamic. We offer all types of accommodations, allowing guests to find spaces suited to their individual needs under these circumstances. We have worked closely with our hosts, guests, and communities to prioritize and support safe and responsible travel during these challenging times and have adapted our offerings for changing trends in travel and experiences.
Specifically, based on the increase in domestic and short-distance travel, we updated our website and mobile apps to actively promote available local and non-urban stays so guests can find something that fits their unique needs for location and desired length of time. In addition, in order to support hosts and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic, we applied our extenuating circumstances policy to a significant number of impacted reservations. This policy allows hosts and guests to cancel reservations that are disrupted by epidemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies. To support our hosts and lessen the impact of cancellations under this policy, we committed up to $250 million for hosts impacted by COVID-19 and an additional $17 million fund for Superhosts, the majority of which was distributed as of December 31, 2020. The reservations eligible for the $250 million host program were defined as reservations made on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Check-ins represent individual stays or experiences that occur during a period that have not been canceled. For these reservations, eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the host’s cancellation policies.
Our Platform
Our Platform for Hosts
Hosts have a variety of needs, and we are focused on designing solutions to serve them. We built our platform to seamlessly onboard new hosts, especially those who previously had not considered hosting. We partner with hosts throughout the process of setting up their listing and provide them with a robust suite of tools to successfully manage their listings, including scheduling, merchandising, integrated payments, community support, host protections, pricing recommendations, and feedback from reviews. Our host protection program provides property damage protection of up to $1 million for every listing and liability coverage to hosts of up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of third-party claims of personal injury or property damage. We are constantly innovating our platform to deliver new tools and services to make hosting easier and empower hosts to earn income doing what they love.
Our Platform for Guests
Airbnb’s website and mobile apps provide our guests with an engaging way to explore a wide variety of unique homes and experiences and an easy way to book them. Our homepage showcases inspiring, browsable content that highlights the product’s range and shows off the best of our inventory. The listing for each stay or experience tells potential guests everything they need to know through photos, reviews from past guests, and detailed descriptions. At checkout, guests can review trip details and pay all on one simplified screen. Everything a guest needs to know before, during, or after their trip is stored on one clear, easy-to-follow page. We enable customizable wishlists for guests in the planning stage of travel, in-app guest-to-host messaging before, during, and after a trip, and an easy way to leave reviews that contribute back to the Airbnb community.
Our System of Trust
One of our core innovations has been the design of a system that allows millions of strangers to trust one another. Hosts and guests have the ability to communicate before booking, pay through our secure payments platform, and post reviews after their stays or experiences. Our trust team works to help protect our community by deploying risk scoring, fraud detection, screening, verification, and other technologies and processes that vary depending on the region. Our trained safety agents are available should our hosts and guests need to reach us. We offer additional support to our community through our Host Guarantee Program which protects hosts against property damage of up to $1 million, and our Host Protection Insurance and Experience Protection Insurance, which provide liability insurance of up to $1 million to protect our hosts against qualifying third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. Through our trust innovations, our goal is to help make Airbnb stays and experiences safe for hosts, guests, and communities.
The system for trust that we have designed includes the following components: reviews, secure messaging and account protection, risk scoring, secure payments, watchlist and background checks in certain jurisdictions, cleanliness, fraud and scam prevention, insurance and protections, booking restrictions, an urgent safety line, 24/7 neighborhood support line, and guest refund policy.
In addition to these components, we have new initiatives in the pipeline and will continue to create additional features to strengthen the trust and safety on our platform. Designing for trust has been a core principle from the very beginning, and as we innovate new ways for strangers to trust one another, we make it possible for more connections to be made.
Our Technology
We built our technology platform to power our global network of hosts and guests. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,480 engineers within our product development organization. Given the nature of the business, our technology platform has broad and complex requirements:
•Our core platform supports global payment capabilities, multilingual real-time community safety and support, and city-specific product requirements, and it contains sophisticated anti-fraud measures.
•It delivers deep business intelligence insights to manage our marketplace, including pricing insights and occupancy optimization for our hosts.
•It incorporates sophisticated machine learning to power key areas, from fraud detection to enabling customized and real-time community support.
•To allow us to respond even more rapidly and efficiently to evolving consumer needs, we are moving our platform from a legacy monolith to a service-oriented architecture.
Our transition to a service-oriented architecture is only one part of a plan to make our core business capabilities available as granular services that accelerate creation of new products and offerings. This work will continue as we build a platform that is increasingly robust, agile, and efficient. In parallel, we will continue to develop our foundational technology with a focus on the following broad capabilities:
•Data management systems that continue to support user privacy, analytics, machine learning, and business insights.
•Service reliability leading to best-in-class performance centered on availability, latency, disaster recovery and business continuity, security, testability, observability, operability, and agility.
•Cloud support focusing on robust capabilities for granular attribution and usage patterns to realize efficiency gains. We currently rely primarily on Amazon Web Services to provide cloud computing services.
Our aim in making these investments is to continue to develop a robust platform that allows us to more quickly adapt to the needs of our hosts and guests around the world and increase the productivity of our product development organization.
Our Marketing
Our marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications, and performance marketing. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential hosts and guests, helping them understand the benefits of hosting and booking stays and experiences and what makes these stays and experiences distinctly Airbnb. Our communications team works across press, policy, and influencers to share timely and important news about Airbnb. They also oversee the execution of a global consumer, product, corporate, and policy communications plan that supports our brand strategy and generates considerable press and social media coverage. While performance marketing drives additional traffic from high-intent prospective guests, the strength of the Airbnb brand and our communications strategy allows us to be less reliant on performance marketing.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 5,597 employees in 27 cities around the world. Because of the COVID-19 crisis, we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 1,800 employees in May 2020, which was approximately a quarter of our workforce at the time.
As of December 31, 2020, we relied on a network of approximately 7,570 third-party partners that are spread across 24 sites, and individuals who work from home around the world to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts. Our internal community support employees are comprised of operations teams who handle complex and sensitive issues and enablement teams who support all community-facing teams, including our partners. We are proud of our approach to working with partners and our deep relationships with them.
Our Culture
The most defining part of working at Airbnb is our culture. Our culture is optimistic, with people who are passionate about our mission, caring about others, and curious about the world. We took the unique characteristics of the people at Airbnb and distilled them to four values:
•Champion the mission. Our employees are deeply passionate about connection and belonging, and the product that we make to deliver this. In fact, many of our employees are people from our host and guest community whom we hired.
•Be a host. Our employees are the kind of people who like caring for others and making them feel like they belong, just like the hosts in our community.
•Embrace the adventure. Our employees are curious and optimistic - you have to be an optimistic person to believe that the idea of Airbnb is a good one, and you have to be curious about other people and cultures to want to connect with them.
•Be a cereal entrepreneur. Our employees are bold and resourceful.
We believe that every person who joins Airbnb, from board members and executives to college new hires, should share these four attributes. Most importantly, we believe that whatever we want to happen outside the walls of Airbnb should first start inside Airbnb. This starts with our own employees. In this way, our culture is the source of all future innovation, and a North Star for how people in our community should treat each other.
Diversity and Belonging
At Airbnb, diversity and belonging is more than a corporate responsibility - it is central to what we stand for. We attract a diverse group of people and welcome their varied knowledge, experiences, and backgrounds. Through our hiring process, we commit to encouraging diversity and eliminating bias, and we publish the changing demographic makeup of our workforce to hold ourselves accountable.
As of December 31, 2020, under-represented minority populations represented 12% of our U.S.-based employees and those who identify in the gender binary as women made up 47% of our global employees. We have set a goal for ourselves by the end of 2025 to have 20% of our product development and information technology employees be under-represented minorities at all levels, 20% of our U.S. employees be under-represented minorities, and 50% of employees at all levels be women, using the gender binary. Also, we announced a commitment that 20% of our Board of Directors and Executive Team, collectively, will be people of color by the end of 2021.
Reducing the Incidents of Bias on Airbnb
Airbnb is centered around belonging, and discrimination is a central obstacle to it. Just as discrimination exists in society, it exists in the Airbnb community, and we are committed to combating it. In 2016, we began taking steps to address discrimination on Airbnb.
First, we created the Airbnb Nondiscrimination Policy, which we required every host and guest to agree to in order to use Airbnb. If a host or guest does not agree to the policy, they are removed from our platform.
Next, we created an anti-discrimination team of technical professionals that work to fight bias and discrimination, changed the way we show profile photos so hosts only see a guest’s photo after a reservation is confirmed, and distributed an antiracism guide to our hosts and guests in the United States.
Most recently, in June 2020, we launched Project Lighthouse, a groundbreaking project launched in partnership with Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization, along with guidance from civil rights groups and privacy rights organizations. Project Lighthouse will allow us to measure discrimination on Airbnb based on perception. These perceptions will be aggregated and used to identify and measure discrepancies in people’s experiences that could be the result of discrimination. We will use the findings from Project Lighthouse to inform and design our products and policies to combat racial discrimination that Black guests and other people of color face when using Airbnb.
Regulations
We are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business at city, state and country levels. While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the approximately 100,000 cities where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our hosts and guests could be negatively impacted. We seek to work with governments to establish clear, fair, and workable home sharing rules to create clarity for our hosts.
No single city represented more than 1.1% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 1.2% of our active listings as of December 31, 2020. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities. We do not believe that the current regulations in our top 10 cities, in the aggregate, have had or are expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to collaborate with policymakers to implement sensible legislation around the world.
In addition to laws, regulations, and rules directly applicable to the short-term rental and home sharing business, we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and rules governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws, regulations, and rules governing the provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our platform and services.
Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; stored value and prepaid access; foreign exchange; privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity; banking secrecy; payment services (including payment processing and settlement services); consumer protection; economic and trade sanctions; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state, and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions against our hosts and guests. In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect and remit various taxes on behalf of our
hosts. We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct or indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in disputes with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various types of taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied.
As we continue to expand the reach of our brand into additional markets, we will be increasingly subject to additional laws, regulations, and rules. These laws, regulations, and rules are complex and constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some of these laws, regulations, and rules are inconsistent and ambiguous and are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws, regulations, and rules have not historically been applied in the context of the short-term rental and home sharing business, so the application and interpretation of these requirements are often uncertain.
For additional information regarding these and other laws, regulations, and rules that affect us and our business, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal and Regulatory Matters - Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements.
Risks Related to Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, governments have imposed various restrictions, including emergency declarations at the federal, state, and local levels, school and business closings, quarantines, “shelter at home” orders, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other social distancing measures, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operations and on travel behavior and demand.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and may continue to require cost reduction measures, has materially adversely affected our near-term operating and financial results and will continue to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results. During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infections emerged. As a result, countries imposed strict lockdowns, in particular in Europe. Similar to the impact of the initial COVID-19 wave in March 2020, we are seeing a decrease in bookings in the most affected regions and saw a significantly greater year-over-year decline in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and extent of the spread of COVID-19 both globally and within the United States, the prevalence of local, national, and international travel restrictions, significantly reduced flight volume, the impact on capital and financial markets and on the U.S. and global economies, foreign currencies exchange, and governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Moreover, even after shelter-in-place orders and travel advisories are lifted, demand for our offerings, particularly those related to cross-border travel, may remain depressed for a significant length of time, and we cannot predict if and when demand will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have on our business partners and third-party vendors and service providers, and we may continue to be materially adversely impacted as a result of the material adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer now and in the future. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these “Risk Factors” or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, will materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 1,800 employees. This reduction in workforce particularly impacted our marketing, design, customer service, transportation, Airbnb Studios, Hotels, and Airbnb Luxe teams. This reduction in workforce also resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge, relationships, and expertise for critical roles, which may not have been effectively transferred to continuing employees and may divert attention from operating our business, create personnel capacity constraints, and hamper our ability to grow, develop innovative products, and compete. Any of these impacts could materially adversely impact our business and reputation and impede our ability to operate or meet strategic objectives. This has led to increased attrition and could lead to reduced employee morale and productivity and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The reduction in force and other restructuring activities resulted in a charge of $151.4 million in 2020.
Most of our employees and third-party vendors and service providers are working remotely, and it is possible that widespread remote work arrangements could have a materially negative impact on host and guest satisfaction resulting from potential delays or slower than usual response times in receiving assistance from our customer support organization. The negative impact on our hosts’ and guests’ satisfaction could adversely impact our operations, the execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-party service providers that perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurs that impacts our employees’ ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in material consumer privacy, information technology security, and fraud risks. The reduction in force in May 2020 and remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize an impairment of certain of our real property lease arrangements, and depending on the duration and extent of the remote work arrangements, we may incur additional impairment charges related to our real property lease agreements. The manner in which we have adjusted our business following the COVID-19 pandemic is based on our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities, and is subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments.
We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve profitability.
We incurred net losses of $16.9 million, $674.3 million, and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.0 billion. Historically, we have invested significantly in efforts to grow our host and guest community, introduced new or enhanced offerings and features, increased our marketing spend, expanded our operations, hired additional employees, and enhanced our platform. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, we have significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs including a reduction in force and a suspension of substantially all discretionary marketing program spend. However, overall, we expect to resume making significant investments in our business and our host and guest community, including improvements to our payments platform, trust and safety on our platform, technology, infrastructure, and investments in our brand. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. In particular, we expect the ongoing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to materially and adversely impact our revenue and financial results for 2021. While we have enacted measures to reduce our expenses, we expect to incur a significant net loss for 2021 primarily as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, stock-based compensation expense, and interest expense.
Certain of our offerings and certain regions in which we operate result in listings with lower service fees and will require significant additional investments from us, which could have a materially negative impact on our overall operating margins as these offerings and regions increase in size over time relative to other areas in which we operate. For example, seats for Airbnb Experiences are generally booked at lower prices than nights booked for stays. In addition, we have changed, and may in the future reduce, our service fees for strategic or competitive reasons. Any failure to increase our revenue or any failure to manage the increase in our operating expenses could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability as measured by net income, operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA.
We have granted restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to our employees and certain non-employees, with substantially all of such RSUs vesting upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity-based vesting condition. Our financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended include stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion associated with the vesting of RSUs in connection with our initial public offering for which the requisite service-based vesting condition was met as of December 31, 2020. Following our initial public offering in December 2020, we began recording stock-based compensation expense for RSUs where the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for the initial public offering on December 9, 2020. Stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other equity awards will continue to be a significant expense in future periods.
Our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have been declining, and this trend could continue.
We had Adjusted EBITDA of $170.6 million, $(253.3) million, and $(250.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Our Free Cash Flow was $504.9 million, $97.3 million, and $(667.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow declined in 2019, as a result of our decision to make 2019 a year in which we made significant investments in new product and growth initiatives, including in China, and to improve our technical infrastructure. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the travel industry, our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow remained negative in 2020, and we may experience declines in Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially adversely impact our business. Other adverse developments in our business, including lower than anticipated revenue, higher than anticipated operating expenses, and net unfavorable changes in working capital, could hinder our ability to reverse the recent negative trend in our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. If our future Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, it is likely to have a materially negative effect on our stock price. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental metrics that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP and for additional information.
Our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future.
We have experienced significant revenue growth in the past; however, our revenue growth has slowed in recent periods and there is no assurance that historic growth rates will return. Our year-over-year growth rate in revenue decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 and also decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue decreased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries. In addition, we believe that our revenue growth depends upon a number of factors, including:
•the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the travel and accommodations industries;
•our ability to retain and grow the number of guests and Nights and Experiences Booked;
•our ability to retain and grow the number of hosts and the number of available listings on our platform;
•events beyond our control such as pandemics and other health concerns, increased or continuing restrictions on travel and immigration, trade disputes, economic downturns, and the impact of climate change on travel, including fires, floods, severe weather and other natural disasters, and the impact of climate change on seasonal destinations;
•competition;
•the legal and regulatory landscape and changes in the application of existing laws and regulations or adoption of new laws and regulations that impact our business, hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy and tax laws;
•the attractiveness of home sharing to prospective hosts and guests;
•the level of consumer awareness and perception of our brand;
•our ability to build and strengthen trust and safety on our platform and among members of our community;
•the level of spending on brand and performance marketing to attract hosts and guests to our platform;
•our ability to grow new offerings and tiers, such as Airbnb Experiences, and to deepen our presence in certain geographies;
•timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades to our platform and infrastructure; and
•other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
A softening of demand, whether caused by events outside of our control, such as COVID-19, changes in host and guest preferences, any of the other factors described above, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or otherwise, will result in decreased revenue. If our revenue does not improve, we may not achieve profitability and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
If we fail to retain existing hosts or add new hosts, or if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Our business depends on hosts maintaining their listings on our platform and engaging in practices that encourage guests to book those listings, including increasing the number of nights and experiences that are available to book, providing timely responses to inquiries from guests, offering a variety of desirable and differentiated listings at competitive prices that meet the expectations of guests, and offering exceptional hospitality, services, and experiences to guests. These practices are outside of our direct control. If hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings, the number of Nights and Experiences Booked declines for a particular period, or the price charged by hosts declines, our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept bookings from prospective guests. We have had many hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons. While we plan to continue to invest in our host community and in tools to assist hosts, these investments may not be successful in growing our hosts and listings on our platform. In addition, hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate bookings from a large number of guests. If we are unable to retain existing hosts or add new hosts, or if hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross-list with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform. In particular, it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual hosts who list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb. We attract individual hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition. If we are unable to attract and retain individual hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Professional hosts, including property management companies, serviced apartment providers, and boutique hotels, expand the types of listings available to our guests. These professional hosts often list on our platform as well as on the platforms of our competitors. We do not control whether professional hosts provide us with a sizable allocation of rooms and competitive pricing relative to the same properties listed with other services. If we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools, application programming interfaces, and payment processes, work with third-party channel managers, and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional hosts, we may not be able to attract and retain professional hosts. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors, these professional hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us. Historically, we have seen an increase in the number of, and revenue from, professional hosts on our platform. The uniqueness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual hosts does not grow at the same rate.
In addition, the number of listings on Airbnb has declined and may continue to decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting hosts, including: the COVID-19 pandemic; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws; private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing; leases, mortgages and other agreements, or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing; hosts opting for long-term rentals on other third-party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform; economic, social, and political factors; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform; negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage host property, throw unauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts; and our decision to remove hosts from our platform for not adhering to our host standards or other factors we deem detrimental to our community. We believe a number of our hosts are individuals who rely on the additional income generated from our platform to pay their living expenses or mortgages or have acquired properties specifically for listing. It is not yet clear what financial impact the severe travel reduction occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic will have on these individuals or whether they will be able to keep their homes or operate their businesses as travel resumes. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if our hosts are unable to return to normal operations in the near to immediate term.
We believe that our host protection programs are integral to retaining and acquiring hosts. Our Host Protection Insurance and Experience Protection Insurance provide liability coverage to our hosts, with amounts paid to claimants, for up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of a third-party claim of bodily injury or property damage related to a stay or experience, and our Host Guarantee Program provides reimbursement of up to $1 million for loss or damages to a host property caused by guests during a reservation. If we discontinue these programs, whether because our payouts under these programs or our insurance premiums become cost prohibitive or for any other reason, then the number of hosts who list with us may decline.
In addition to a reduction in the number of bookings, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, higher than normal payments via refunds and travel credit issuance to guests who cancel for reasons related to COVID-19. Under our extenuating circumstances policy, guests who made reservations on or before March 14, 2020 and cannot travel due to the pandemic have been eligible to cancel their reservations for a full cash refund or in some cases travel credit. Similarly, hosts with reservations confirmed on or before March 14, 2020 who cannot host due to the pandemic have been eligible to cancel under this policy without adverse consequences. A large number of guest cancellations under the policy caused lost earnings for our hosts. To support our hosts and lessen the impact of cancellations under
our extenuating circumstances policy, we have made a $250 million commitment, the majority of which has been distributed as of December 31, 2020, which provides hosts a portion of the amount they expected to earn from bookings that were canceled under this policy. The reservations eligible for this support program were defined as reservations made on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and May 31, 2020. For these reservations, eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the host’s cancellation policies. Because this commitment is limited in amount and timeframe, hosts will not receive full payment related to guest cancellations, and some hosts may remove their listings from our platform if they are not satisfied with our policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not seen a material change in the number of active listings on our platform between December 2019 and December 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $205.1 million in payments to customers under this policy.
Hosts and guests whose reservations are canceled under our extenuating circumstances policy have had and may continue to have a negative view of such policy and may experience negative financial impacts as a result of such cancellations. This could materially negatively impact our relationship with our hosts and guests, resulting in hosts leaving our platform, removing their listings and/or offering less availability, or fewer repeat guests, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If we fail to retain existing guests or add new guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Our success depends significantly on existing guests continuing to book and attracting new guests to book on our platform. Our ability to attract and retain guests could be materially adversely affected by a number of factors discussed elsewhere in these “Risk Factors,” including:
•events beyond our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics and health concerns, increased or continuing restrictions on travel, immigration, trade disputes, economic downturns, and the impact of climate change on travel, including fires, floods, severe weather and other natural disasters, and the impact of climate change on seasonal destinations;
•political, social or economic instability;
•hosts failing to meet guests’ expectations, including increased expectations for cleanliness in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•increased competition and use of our competitors’ platforms and services;
•hosts failing to provide differentiated, high-quality, and an adequate supply of stays or experiences at competitive prices;
•guests not receiving timely and adequate community support from us;
•our failure to provide new or enhanced offerings, tiers, or features that guests value;
•declines or inefficiencies in our marketing efforts;
•negative associations with, or reduced awareness of, our brand;
•actual or perceived racial discrimination by hosts in deciding whether to accept a requested reservation;
•negative perceptions of the trust and safety on our platform; and
•macroeconomic and other conditions outside of our control affecting travel and hospitality industries generally.
In addition, if our platform is not easy to navigate, guests have an unsatisfactory sign-up, search, booking, or payment experience on our platform, the listings and other content provided on our platform is not displayed effectively to guests, we are not effective in engaging guests across our various offerings and tiers, or we fail to provide an experience in a manner that meets rapidly changing demand, we could fail to convert first-time guests and fail to engage with existing guests, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Any further and continued decline or disruption in the travel and hospitality industries or economic downturn would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused many governments to implement quarantines and significant restrictions on travel or to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds, which has had a particularly negative impact on cross-border travel. In addition, most airlines have suspended or significantly reduced their flights during this period, further decreasing opportunities for travel. This has led to a decrease in our bookings and an increase in cancellations and associated claims brought against us. We expect that COVID-19 will continue to materially adversely impact our bookings and business in 2021 and beyond. The extent and duration of such impact over the longer term remains uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of a vaccine, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general, and on our business in particular. See our risk factor titled “- The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Other events beyond our control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, tsunamis, floods, severe weather, droughts, and volcanic eruptions, and travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, restrictions related to travel, trade or immigration policies, wars, terrorist attacks, sources of political uncertainty, such as the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (“Brexit”), political unrest, protests, violence in connection with political or social events, foreign policy changes, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in regulations, policies, or conditions related to sustainability, including climate change, work stoppages, labor unrest or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel globally or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our platform and services, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Events such as sudden outbreaks of wars or regional instability have led to a large number of localized cancellations
and safety concerns, which harm our business and our relationship with our hosts and guests. In addition, increasing awareness around the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over-tourism may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services.
Our financial performance is also subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, worldwide or regional recession, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, fluctuations in exchange rates, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions, such as the current downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending, and similar downturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services. Such a shift in consumer behavior would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.
We operate in a highly competitive environment and we face significant competition in attracting hosts and guests.
•Hosts. We compete to attract, engage, and retain hosts on our platform to list their spaces and experiences. Hosts have a range of options for listing their spaces and experiences, both online and offline. It is also common for hosts to cross-list their offerings. We compete for hosts based on many factors, including the volume of bookings generated by our guests; ease of use of our platform (including onboarding, community support, and payments); the service fees we charge; host protections, such as our Host Protection Insurance, Experience Protection Insurance and Host Guarantee Program; and our brand. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on our cancellation and extenuating circumstances policies.
•Guests. We compete to attract, engage, and retain guests on our platform. Guests have a range of options to find and book spaces, hotel rooms, serviced apartments, and other accommodations and experiences, both online and offline. We compete for guests based on many factors, including unique inventory and availability of listings, the value and all-in cost of our offerings relative to other options, our brand, ease of use of our platform, the relevance and personalization of search results, the trust and safety of our platform, and community support. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on the availability of inventory close to where guests live and in non-urban markets as well as the perceived safety and cleanliness of listings on our platform.
We believe that our competitors include:
•OTAs such as Booking Holdings (including the brands Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline.com, and Agoda.com); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity); Trip.com Group (including the brands Ctrip.com, Trip.com, Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba); Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs;
•Internet search engines, such as Google, including its travel search products; Baidu; and other regional search engines;
•Listing and meta search websites, such as TripAdvisor, Trivago, Mafengwo, AllTheRooms.com, and Craigslist;
•Hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels;
•Chinese short-term rental competitors, such as Tujia, Meituan B&B, and Xiaozhu; and
•Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, and KKDay.
Our competitors are adopting aspects of our business model, which could affect our ability to differentiate our offerings from competitors. Increased competition could result in reduced demand for our platform from hosts and guests, slow our growth, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as greater name and brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and loyalty programs, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. In addition, our current or potential competitors have access to larger user bases and/or inventory for accommodations, and may provide multiple travel products, including flights. As a result, our competitors may be able to provide consumers with a better or more complete product experience and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or host and guest requirements or preferences. The global travel industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry. Consolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources, and lower their cost structures. In addition, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing a new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new offerings or technologies before us.
There are now numerous competing companies that offer homes for booking, which can be available on our platform, on competing platforms, and through direct booking sites. Some of these competitors also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources, including the websites of property managers. Some of our hosts have chosen to cross-list their properties, which reduces the availability of such properties on our platform. When properties are cross-listed, the price paid by guests on our platform may be or may appear to be less
competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies, which may cause guests to book through other services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Certain property managers reach out to our hosts and guests to incentivize them to list or book directly with them and bypass our platform, and certain hosts may encourage transactions outside of our platform, which reduces the use of our platform and services.
Some of our competitors or potential competitors have more established or varied relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by entering the travel and accommodations businesses. For example, some competitors or potential competitors are creating “super-apps” where consumers can use many online services without leaving that company’s app, e.g., in particular regions, such as Asia, where e-commerce transactions are conducted primarily through apps on mobile devices. If any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to ours to consumers, or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs, including our brand and performance marketing expenses, could increase, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also face increasing competition from search engines including Google. How Google presents travel search results, and its promotion of its own travel meta-search services, such as Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, or similar actions from other search engines, and their practices concerning search rankings, could decrease our search traffic, increase traffic acquisition costs, and/or disintermediate our platform. These parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools, or refer leads directly to suppliers, other favored partners, or themselves, which could also disintermediate our platform. In addition, if Google or Apple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, it could materially adversely affect our ability to engage with hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search.
Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business. Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In Europe, a group of mayors representing 22 cities (including Amsterdam, Barcelona, and London) has been meeting with the European Commission to seek increased regulatory control in relation to short-term rental platforms. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities, and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term rental of properties and/or home sharing. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban hosts from short-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of days hosts can share their homes, require hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as “hotel use” and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process. Macroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that limit the ability of hosts to share their spaces. If laws, regulations, rules, or agreements significantly restrict or discourage hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the approximately 100,000 cities where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our hosts and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if new city regulations requiring us to share host data with such city are implemented, our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of hosts who do not wish to share their data with the city. A reduction in supply and cancellations could make our platform less attractive to guests, and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of hosts on our platform.
While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past, and are likely in the future to, become involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations. For example, some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short-term accommodations in violation of applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes, including lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, on our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our hosts and/or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully described in our risk factor titled “- Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.” In addition, some third parties and regulators have asserted that we, through our operations, are subject to regulations with respect to short-term rentals, host registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences, such as real estate broker or agent licenses, travel agency licenses, and insurance-related licenses. We could be held liable and incur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing, among other things, to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short-term rentals as well as the enforcement of safety regulations, and to implement measures to confirm to the government that hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law. When a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curtails hosts’ or guests’ ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography, we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. Further, if we or our hosts and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations, government requests, or
agreements with government agencies that adversely impact our relations with hosts and guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement will likely be publicly available and could create a precedent that may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments.
We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Hosts list, and guests search for, stays and experiences on our platform in more than 220 countries and regions, and in approximately 100,000 cities throughout the world. There are national, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations in jurisdictions that relate to or affect our business. Moreover, the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate are distinct and may result in inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations applicable to our business. Compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing varying standards and requirements is burdensome for businesses like ours, imposes added cost and increases potential liability to our business, and makes it difficult to realize business efficiencies and economies of scale. For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of disparate requirements can lead to compliance gaps if our internal resources cannot keep up with the pace of regulatory change and new requirements imposed on our platform, or if our platform does not work as intended or has errors or bugs.
It may be difficult or impossible for us to investigate or evaluate laws or regulations in all cities, countries, and regions. The application of existing laws and regulations to our business and platform can be unclear and may be difficult for hosts, guests, and us to understand and apply, and are subject to change, as governments or government agencies seek to apply legacy systems of laws or adopt new laws to new online business models in the travel and accommodations industries, including ours. Uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services, increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See also our risk factor titled “- We could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform.”
There are laws that apply to us, and there are laws that apply to our hosts and/or guests. While we require our hosts and guests to comply with their own independent legal obligations under our terms of service, we have limited means of enforcing or ensuring the compliance of our hosts and guests with all applicable legal requirements. Sometimes governments try to hold us responsible for laws that apply to our hosts and/or guests. Whether applicable to us, our hosts, and/or our guests, the related consequences arising out of such laws and regulations, including penalties for violations of and costs to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We take certain measures to comply, and to help hosts comply, with laws and regulations, such as requiring registration numbers to be displayed on a listing profile for listings in some jurisdictions where such registration is required. These measures, changes to them, and any future measures we adopt could increase friction on our platform, and reduce the number of listings available on our platform from hosts and bookings by guests, and could reduce the activity of hosts and guests on our platform. We may be subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage hosts and guests from using our platform. Our newer offerings, such as Airbnb Experiences, are subject to similar or other laws, regulations, and regulatory actions. In particular, if we become more involved in hosts’ listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform.
In addition to laws and regulations directly applicable to the short-term rental and home sharing business as discussed in our risk factor titled “- Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition,” we are subject to laws and regulations governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the provision of online payment services and insurance services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our platform and services.
We are also subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws regulating employment, employee working conditions, including wage and hour laws, employment dispute and employee bargaining processes, collective and representative actions, employment classification, and other employment compliance requirements.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions have also adopted laws, rules, regulations, and/or decrees intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing travel restrictions or restricting access to city centers or limiting accommodation offerings in surrounding areas. In addition, many jurisdictions have limited social mobility and gatherings. As the COVID-19 pandemic develops, governments, corporations, and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that could further restrict the ability of our hosts and guests to participate on our platform.
There is increased governmental interest in regulating technology companies in areas including privacy, tax, data localization and data access, algorithm-based discrimination, and competition. In addition, climate change and greater emphasis on sustainability could lead to regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of housing and travel. As a result, governments may enact new laws and regulations and/or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, and in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We incur significant expenses and commit significant resources to maintain our platform in compliance with laws and regulations; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully implement technical upgrades and other system implementations in a timely manner since implementations often involve building new infrastructure and tools, which contain the inherent risk of unplanned errors and defects.
Any new or existing laws and regulations applicable to existing or future business areas, including amendments to or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or new interpretations, applications, or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and materially adversely impact bookings on our platform, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, the laws and regulations that impact our United Kingdom and European Union operations, including payment processing, privacy and data protection, legal protection for platforms, workers’ rights, and intellectual property, will change after the end of the transitional period following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union. In addition, the European Union’s new Platform to Business Regulation, which came into effect in July 2020, required us to make updates to the terms that apply to our business customers, introduce new dispute resolution procedures with business customers, and make changes to our community support operations. Furthermore, some of our hosts or some of our offerings may now or in the future be subject to the European Package Travel Directive, which imposes various obligations upon package providers and upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers. Our efforts to influence legislative and regulatory proposals have an uncertain chance of success, could be limited by laws regulating lobbying or advocacy activity in certain jurisdictions, and even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert the attention of management from operations.
We are subject to regulatory inquiries, litigation, and other disputes, which have materially adversely affected and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have been, and expect to continue to be, a party to various legal and regulatory claims, litigation or pre-litigation disputes, and proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The number and significance of these claims, disputes, and proceedings have increased as our company has grown larger, the number of bookings on our platform has increased, there is increased brand awareness, and the scope and complexity of our business have expanded, and we expect they will continue to increase.
We have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to various government inquiries, investigations, and proceedings related to legal and regulatory requirements such as compliance with laws related to short-term rentals and home sharing, tax, consumer protection, pricing, advertising, discrimination, data protection, data sharing, payment processing, privacy, and competition. In many cases, these inquiries, investigations, and proceedings can be complex, time consuming, costly to investigate, and require significant company and also management attention. For certain matters, we are implementing recommended changes to our products, operations, and compliance practices, including enabling tax collection, tax reporting, display of host registration numbers, and removal of noncompliant listings. We are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings on our business, and such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings could result in damages, large fines and penalties and require changes to our products and operations, and materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being adapted and implemented to address certain aspects of our business, and such adoption or change in their interpretation could further alter or impact our business and subject us to future government inquiries, investigations, and proceedings.
We have been involved in litigation with national governments, trade associations and industry bodies, municipalities, and other government authorities, including as a plaintiff and as a defendant, concerning laws seeking to limit or outlaw short-term rentals and to impose obligations or liability on us as a platform. In the United States, we have been involved in various lawsuits concerning whether our platform is responsible for alleged wrongful conduct by hosts who engage in short-term rentals. Claims in such cases have alleged illegal hotel conversions, real estate license requirements, violations of municipal law around short-term occupancy or rentals, unlawful evictions, or violations of lease provisions or homeowners’ association rules. Legal claims have been asserted for alleged discriminatory conduct undertaken by hosts against certain guests, and for our own platform policies or business practices. Changes to the interpretation of the applicability of fair housing, civil rights or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), and non-U.S. laws such as the European E-Commerce Directive and its national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable.
In addition, we face claims and litigation relating to fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, illness (including COVID-19), cancellations and refunds, personal injuries, property damage, carbon monoxide incidents, and privacy violations that occurred at listings or experiences during a booking made on our platform. We also have putative class action litigation and government inquiries, and could face additional litigation and government inquiries and fines relating to our business practices, cancellations and other consequences due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond our control such as wars, regional hostilities, health concerns, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or law enforcement demands and other regulatory actions.
Notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) on December 19, 2019 ruling that Airbnb is a provider of information society services under the E-Commerce Directive, there continue to be new laws and government initiatives within the European Union attempting to regulate Airbnb as a platform. In several cases, national courts are evaluating whether certain local rules imposing obligations on platforms can be enforced against us. For example, we are challenging laws in various European jurisdictions
requiring short-term rental platforms to act as withholding tax agent for host income taxes, to collect and remit tourist taxes, and to disclose user data. Adverse rulings in these national cases are possible and could result in changes to our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and lead to a loss of revenue for us. In addition, the European Union plans to amend the E-Commerce Directive by means of the Digital Services Act.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, disputes may arise because we are alleged to have infringed third parties’ intellectual property or in which we agree to provide indemnification to third parties with respect to certain matters, including losses arising from our breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims, or where we make other contractual commitments to third parties. We also have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors, executive officers, and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We may be subject to litigation stemming from these obligations.
Adverse results in any regulatory inquiry, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims may include awards of potentially significant monetary damages, including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions, penalties, fines, injunctive relief, royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain services. Moreover, many regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims are resolved by settlements that can include both monetary and nonmonetary components. Adverse results or settlements may result in changes in our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and a loss of revenue. In addition, any litigation or pre-litigation claims against us, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, require substantial expense, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We use various software platforms that in some instances have limited functionality which may impede our ability to fully retrieve records. In addition, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. As we continue to grow, regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, and other claims will continue to consume significant company resources and adverse results in future matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform.
We could face claims relating to information or content that is made available on our platform. Our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by hosts, guests, or other third parties. Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our hosts and guests. While we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the DMCA, the CDA, the fair-use doctrine and various tort law defenses in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity or responsibility, requirements to maintain immunity or proportionate responsibility, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts and guests or otherwise contributed by third-parties to our platform. Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. There have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, in particular with regards to Section 230 of the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. There is proposed U.S. federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user-generated content, including content related to short-term rentals. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. The European Union is also reviewing the regulation of digital services, and in December 2020, the European Commission published a draft of the proposed Digital Services Act (“DSA”), a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services, which could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided by the E-Commerce Directive. Some European jurisdictions have also proposed or intend to pass legislation that imposes new obligations and liabilities on platforms with respect to certain types of harmful content. In parallel, the European Commission also published a legislative proposal to introduce new ex ante regulation of online platforms and new market investigation powers as a separate piece of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”). If the DMA is enacted, it may contain certain regulatory requirements and/or obligations that negatively impact our business. Some European jurisdictions (such as the United Kingdom and Germany) are also reviewing their competition rules in relation to digital platforms which could lead to new regulations similar to the DMA at national level. While the scope and timing of these proposals are currently evolving, if enacted and applied to our platform, the new rules may adversely affect our business. In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes as the CDA or E-Commerce Directive. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and/or services accessed through our platform, as we continue to expand our offerings, tiers, and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations, we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by third parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may require us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to hosts and guests, may cause damage to our brand or reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In the European Union, the Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive harmonized consumer rights across the EU member states. In 2018, the European Commission and a group of European consumer protection authorities (through the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network) investigated our customer terms and price display practices, which required us to make certain changes to our terms and price display practices. If Consumer Protection Regulators find that we are in breach of consumer protection laws, we may be fined or required to change our terms and processes, which may result in increased operational costs. Consumers and certain Consumer Protection Associations may also bring individual claims against us if they believe that our terms and/or business practices are not in
compliance with local consumer protection laws. Currently, class actions may also be brought in certain countries in the European Union, and the Collective Redress Directive will extend the right to collective redress across the European Union.
Home sharing may not achieve global acceptance.
While home sharing has grown in popularity, home sharing may not achieve global acceptance, particularly in regions where home sharing may not be deemed attractive to hosts and guests due to cultural considerations. The attractiveness of our platform for hosts and guests is impacted by a number of factors, including the willingness of individual hosts to offer their homes on our platform, the willingness of guests to book stays at homes in lieu of more traditional options, such as hotels, our ability to continue to extend our operating model internationally and offer localized services that are desirable to our hosts and guests, and our ability to offer cost-effective alternatives to traditional accommodations. Furthermore, both hosts and guests may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform because of concerns regarding their safety or the quality of their stays. Many hosts and guests are apprehensive about or not willing to share homes due to concerns surrounding the transmission of COVID-19, and if they are willing to share homes, their ability to do so may be restricted by laws, rules, regulations, or decrees adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This uncertainty surrounding acceptance of home sharing is exacerbated by the legacy system of laws and regulations that govern short and long-term accommodations, travel services, real estate brokerage services, and taxes, which generally does not directly address the online home sharing business model. If home sharing does not achieve global acceptance, our growth could be limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our growth, and negative publicity could damage our brand and thereby harm our ability to compete effectively, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract hosts, guests, and employees, to compete effectively, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing hosts, guests, and employees, to maintain and improve our standing in the communities where our hosts operate, including our standing with community leaders and regulatory bodies, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and government investigations. We are heavily dependent on the perceptions of hosts and guests who use our platform to help make word-of-mouth recommendations that contribute to our growth.
Any incident, whether actual or rumored to have occurred, involving the safety or security of listings, hosts, guests, or other members of the public, fraudulent transactions, or incidents that are mistakenly attributed to Airbnb, and any media coverage resulting therefrom, could create a negative public perception of our platform, which would adversely impact our ability to attract hosts and guests. In addition, when hosts cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely refunds to guests in connection with cancellations, guest perception of the value of our platform is adversely impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future. The impact of these issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate community support or our platform policies are perceived to be too permissive, too restrictive, or providing hosts and/or guests with unsatisfactory resolutions. We have been the subject of media reports, social media posts, blogs, and other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints and negative publicity, some hosts have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, listing with us, and some guests have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, using our platform, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In addition, our brand and reputation could be harmed if we fail to act responsibly or are perceived as not acting responsibly, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements as interpreted by certain governments or agencies thereof, in a number of other areas, such as safety and security, data security, privacy practices, provision of information about users and activities on our platform, sustainability, human rights, diversity, non-discrimination, and support for employees and local communities. Media, legislative, or government scrutiny around our company, including the perceived impact on affordable housing and over-tourism, neighborhood nuisance, privacy practices, provision of information as requested by certain governments or agencies thereof, content on our platform, business practices and strategic plans, impact of travel on the environment, and public health policies that may cause geopolitical backlash, our business partners, private companies where we have minority investments, and our practices relating to our platform, offerings, employees, competition, litigation, and response to regulatory activity, could adversely affect our brand and our reputation with our hosts, guests, and communities. Social media compounds the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated and the speed with which such negative publicity may spread. Any resulting damage to our brand or reputation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In addition, we rely on our hosts and guests to provide trustworthy reviews and ratings that our hosts or guests may rely upon to help decide whether or not to book a particular listing or accept a particular booking and that we use to enforce quality standards. We rely on these reviews to further strengthen trust among members of our community. Our hosts and guests may be less likely to rely on reviews and ratings if they believe that our review system does not generate trustworthy reviews and ratings. We have procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of our review system, but we cannot guarantee that these procedures are or will be effective. In addition, if our hosts and guests do not leave reliable reviews and ratings, other potential hosts or guests may disregard those reviews and ratings, and our systems that use reviews and ratings to enforce quality standards would be less effective, which could reduce trust within our community and damage our brand and reputation, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous, or fraudulent activity, may undermine the safety or the perception of safety of our platform and our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have no control over or ability to predict the actions of our users and other third parties, such as neighbors or invitees, either during the guest’s stay, experience, or otherwise, and therefore, we cannot guarantee the safety of our hosts, guests, and third parties. The actions of hosts, guests, and other third parties have resulted and can further result in fatalities, injuries, other bodily harm, fraud, invasion of privacy, property damage, discrimination, brand and reputational damage, which have created and could continue to create potential legal or other substantial liabilities for us. We do not verify the identity of all of our hosts and guests nor do we verify or screen third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. Our identity verification processes rely on, among other things, information provided by hosts and guests, and our ability to validate that information and the effectiveness of third-party service providers that support our verification processes may be limited. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. Certain verification processes, including legacy verification processes on which we previously relied, may be less reliable than others. We screen against certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watch lists, conduct certain criminal background checks for U.S. hosts, U.S. guests, and hosts in India, and conduct additional screening processes to flag and investigate suspicious activities. These processes are beneficial but not exhaustive and have limitations due to a variety of factors, including laws and regulations that prohibit or limit our ability to conduct effective background checks in some jurisdictions, the unavailability of information, and the inability of our systems to detect all suspicious activity. There can be no assurances that these measures will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on our platform. The criminal background checks for U.S. hosts, U.S. guests, and hosts in India, and other screening processes rely on, among other things, information provided by hosts and guests, our ability to validate that information, the accuracy, completeness, and availability of the underlying information relating to criminal records, the digitization of certain records, the evolving regulatory landscape in this area such as in the data privacy space, and on the effectiveness of third-party service providers that may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility, and we do not run criminal background checks and other screening processes on third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform.
In addition, we have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, location, quality, compliance with Airbnb policies or standards, and legal compliance, such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors, of all our hosts’ listings or experiences. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. In the limited circumstances where we have undertaken the verification or screening of certain aspects of host qualifications, listings or experiences, the scope of such processes may be limited and rely on, among other things, information provided by hosts and guests and the ability of our internal teams or third-party vendors to adequately conduct such verification or screening practices. In addition, we have not in the past taken and may not in the future take steps to re-verify or re-screen host qualifications, listings, or experiences following initial review. We have in the past relied, and may in the future, rely on hosts and guests to disclose information relating to their listings and experiences and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete. We have created policies and standards to respond to issues reported with listings, but certain listings may pose heightened safety risks to individual users because those issues have not been reported to us or because our customer support team has not taken the requisite action based on our policies. We rely, at least in part, on reports of issues from hosts and guests to investigate and enforce many of our policies and standards. In addition, our policies may not contemplate certain safety risks posed by listings or individual hosts or guests or may not sufficiently address those risks.
We have also faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations of, among other things, unsafe or unsuitable listings, discriminatory policies, data processing, practices or behavior on and off our platform or by hosts, guests, and third parties, general misrepresentations regarding the safety or accuracy of offerings on our platform, and other host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent. While we recognize that we need to continue to build trust and invest in innovations that will support trust when it comes to our policies, tools, and procedures to protect hosts, guests, and the communities in which our hosts operate, we may not be successful in doing so. Similarly, listings that are inaccurate, of a lower than expected quality, or that do not comply with our policies may harm guests and public perception of the quality and safety of listings on our platform and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If hosts, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, misconduct, fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers may not consider our platform and the listings on our platform safe, and we may receive negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity, which could adversely impact our brand and reputation, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. For example:
•there have been shootings, fatalities, and other criminal or violent acts on properties booked on our platform, including as a result of unsanctioned house parties;
•there have been incidents of sexual violence against hosts, guests, and third parties, and we have seen higher incident rates of such conduct associated with private room and shared space listings;
•there have been undisclosed hidden cameras at properties; and
•there have been incidents of hosts and guests engaging in criminal, fraudulent, or unsafe behavior and other misconduct while using our platform.
The methods used by perpetrators of fraud and other misconduct are complex and constantly evolving, and our trust and security measures have been, and may currently or in the future be, insufficient to detect and help prevent all fraudulent activity and other misconduct; for example:
•there have been incidents where hosts have misrepresented both the quality and location of their properties, in some instances to send guests to different and inferior properties;
•there have been incidents where guests have caused substantial property damage to listings or misrepresented the purpose of their stay and used listings for unauthorized or inappropriate conduct including parties, sex work, drug-related activities, or to perpetrate criminal activities;
•there have been instances where users with connected or duplicate accounts have circumvented or manipulated our systems, in an effort to evade account restrictions, create false reviews, or engage in fraud or other misconduct;
•there have been incidents where fraudsters have created fake guest accounts, fake host accounts, or both, to perpetrate financial fraud; and
•situations have occurred where hosts or guests mistakenly or unintentionally provide malicious third parties access to their accounts, which has allowed those third parties to take advantage of our hosts and guests.
In addition, certain regions where we operate have higher rates of violent crime or more relaxed safety standards, which can lead to more safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform in those regions and elsewhere.
If criminal, inappropriate, fraudulent, or other negative incidents continue to occur due to the conduct of hosts, guests, or third parties, our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests would be harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices. In the United States and other countries, we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of Airbnb’s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence. Further, claims have been asserted against us from our hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to fatalities, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, privacy and security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Even where we do have third-party insurance, such insurance may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings and tiers, such as the addition of Airbnb Experiences, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Measures that we are taking to improve the trust and safety of our platform may cause us to incur significant expenditures and may not be successful.
We have taken and continue to take measures to improve the trust and safety on our platform, combat fraudulent activities and other misconduct and improve community trust, such as requiring identity and other information from hosts and guests, attempting to confirm the location of listings, removing suspected fraudulent listings or listings repeatedly reported by guests to be significantly not as described, and removing hosts and guests who fail to comply with our policies. These measures are long-term investments in our business and the trust and safety of our community; however, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required to list or book, which reduces host and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Implementing the trust and safety initiatives we have announced, which include, among other things, limited verification of hosts and listings, restrictions on “party” houses, manual screening of certain high-risk reservations, restrictions on certain types of bookings, and our neighbor hotline, or other initiatives, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced host and guest retention, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As we operate a global platform, the timing and implementation of these measures will vary across geographies. We have invested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform, but there can be no assurances that these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity.
Furthermore, we have established community standards, but those standards may not always be effectively enforced, communicated to, or consistently understood by all parts of our community. For example, while we require and communicate to hosts and guests to make certain commitments with respect to diversity and belonging when they join Airbnb, these standards and requirements are not always well understood by all parts of our community. As a result, hosts and guests may be surprised or disappointed when their expectations are not met.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted a number of policies and measures to address the use of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we have launched cleaning programs and safety practices that are intended to help prevent transmission of COVID-19. All hosts outside of China are asked to commit to these standards, including a uniform five-step cleaning process (hosts in China maintain a separate cleaning program). We provide substantial additional resources and best practices to help hosts implement the cleaning process, including an enhanced cleaning protocol, checklists, and other written and visual materials. Each host is responsible for implementing the cleaning process. We are unable to control or verify the implementation of this process by each host, and following these programs may cause our hosts to incur significant expenditures, which may impact the attractiveness of our platform and may impact hosts’ willingness to list on our platform. Hosts who do not agree to follow these standards may also be suspended or removed from the platform, and our hosts may choose to list on other platforms instead of participating in our cleaning programs. If a significant number of hosts are removed or decide to list on other platforms as a result of our cleaning programs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Hosts and guests must also agree to follow COVID-19-related safety practices, such as social distancing. If our hosts or guests do not follow the guidelines, they may suffer financial or other repercussions, which may make our platform less appealing and may impact our business. Further, such policies may not be successful in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Cases of suspected COVID-19 exposure or infection during Airbnb reservations have been reported to us. If guests or hosts believe that booking stays or experiences on our platform poses heightened risks for contracting COVID-19 or other diseases, our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected, and it could give rise to legal claims against us.
We rely on traffic to our platform to grow revenue, and if we are unable to drive traffic cost-effectively, it would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and retain hosts and guests. In particular, we rely on marketing to drive guest traffic to our platform. We have invested considerable resources into establishing and maintaining our brand. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual hosts and brand marketing, while reducing performance marketing.
Our brand marketing efforts include a variety of online and offline marketing distribution channels. Our brand marketing efforts are expensive and may not be cost-effective or successful. For example, in November 2019, we announced a partnership with the International Olympic Committee for nine years to cover the next five Olympic Games. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the 2020 Olympics, and the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other geopolitical factors could undermine our ability to realize the value of the partnership. If our competitors spend increasingly more on brand marketing efforts, we may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to our platform.
We have used performance marketing products offered by search engines and social media platforms to distribute paid advertisements that drive traffic to our platform. The remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (“SEO”). A critical factor in attracting hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019. However, we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost-effectively. If we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing, we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
The technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. For example, we rely on the placement and use of “cookies” - text files stored on a host or guest’s web browser or device - to support tailored marketing to consumers. Many countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to “opt-in” to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, we are subject to evolving EU privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. In the European Union, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced by an EU Regulation, known as the ePrivacy Regulation, which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance. In the European Union, informed consent may be required for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, a recent European Court of Justice decision and regulators’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies under existing law. If regulators start to enforce the strict approach, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. Widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective hosts and guests, and thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO. SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform’s content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform. We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search.
Moreover, as guests increase their booking activity across multiple travel sites or compare offerings across sites, our marketing efficiency and effectiveness is adversely impacted, which could cause us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in the future, which may not be offset by additional revenue, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer hosts and guests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures.
Our debt obligations contain restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. If we require additional funding to support our business, this additional funding may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.
We have outstanding long-term indebtedness with a principal amount of $1,995.0 million as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we entered into a five-year revolving credit facility in November 2020 with $500.0 million of initial borrowing commitments (“2020 Credit Facility”) and as of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had total outstanding letters of credit of $54.3 million. The agreements governing our indebtedness (our “Credit Agreements”) contain various
covenants that are operative so long as our Credit Agreements remain outstanding. The covenants, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries’ abilities to:
•incur additional indebtedness;
•create or incur additional liens;
•engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations;
•sell or transfer assets;
•pay dividends and distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock;
•make payments and prepayments of junior or unsecured indebtedness;
•make acquisitions, investments, loans, or advances;
•engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and
•enter into negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions.
If we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in these “Risk Factors” or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our Credit Agreements, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our Credit Agreements. Any such default that is not cured or waived could result in an acceleration of indebtedness then outstanding under our Credit Agreements, a requirement that we and our subsidiaries that have guaranteed our indebtedness pay the obligations in full, and would permit the lenders to exercise remedies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing our indebtedness, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with funding under the 2020 Credit Facility. We cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our Credit Agreements or to remedy any defaults under our Credit Agreements.
Interest rates under our Credit Agreements are based partly on LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, which is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. LIBOR is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available, or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate our Credit Agreements or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital. As we manage through the slowdown in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition.
We have significant indebtedness that could materially adversely affect our business by:
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development efforts, and other general corporate purposes;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as our borrowings are, and may in the future be, at variable interest rates.
The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our Credit Agreements.
If we are unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
We are a global platform with hosts in more than 220 countries and regions and approximately 100,000 cities, and a global guest community. As of December 31, 2020, we had offices in 27 cities and had approximately 2,470 employees located internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 51% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States. We expect to continue to make investments to expand our international operations. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention and careful prioritization, and any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks, which include:
•operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;
•the cost and resources required to localize our platform and services, which often requires the translation of our platform into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;
•unexpected, more restrictive, differing, and conflicting laws and regulations, including those laws governing Internet activities, short-term and long-term rentals (including those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), tourism, tenancy, taxes, licensing, payments processing, messaging, marketing activities, registration and/or verification of guests, ownership of intellectual property, content, data collection and privacy, security, data localization, data transfer and government access to personal information, and other activities important to our business;
•uncertainties regarding the interpretation of national and local laws and regulations, uncertainty in the enforceability of legal rights, and uneven application of laws and regulations to businesses, in particular U.S. companies;
•competition with companies that understand local markets better than we do, or that have a local presence and pre-existing relationships with potential hosts and guests in those markets;
•differing levels of social acceptance of home sharing, our brand, and offerings;
•legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings, the services, and content provided by hosts, guests, and other third parties;
•uncertain resolutions of litigation or regulatory inquiries;
•variations in payment forms for hosts and guests, increased operational complexity around payments, and inability to offer local payment forms like cash or country specific digital forms of payment;
•lack of familiarity and the burden of complying with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws, legal standards, and regulatory requirements, which are complex, sometimes inconsistent, and subject to unexpected changes;
•potentially adverse tax consequences, including resulting from the complexities of foreign corporate income tax systems, value added tax (“VAT”) regimes, tax withholding rules, lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, hotel taxes, and other indirect taxes, tax collection or remittance obligations, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;
•difficulties in managing and staffing international operations, including due to differences in legal, regulatory, and collective bargaining processes;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and in particular, decreases in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;
•regulations governing the control of local currencies and impacting the ability to collect and remit funds to hosts in those currencies or to repatriate cash into the United States;
•oversight by foreign government agencies whose approach to privacy or human rights may be inconsistent with that taken in other countries;
•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities and difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls in an international operating environment;
•political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;
•operating in countries that are more prone to crime or have lower safety standards;
•operating in countries that have higher risk of corruption; and
•reduced or varied protection for our intellectual property rights in some countries.
Increased operating expenses, decreased revenue, negative publicity, negative reaction from our hosts and guests and other stakeholders, or other adverse impacts from any of the above factors or other risks related to our international operations could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In addition to the factors listed above, we have invested heavily to expand our operations in China, which is an intensely competitive market, both on the consumer side and from a talent perspective. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses to operate our business in China, and we may not achieve profitability in that market. As we expand our operations in China, the above factors, sentiment of the workforce in China, and China’s policy towards foreign direct investment may particularly impact our operations in China. Further, as we expand our operations in China, we expect to continue to make modifications to the way our website, mobile apps, offerings, and features function in China as compared to other countries. In addition, we need to ensure that our business practices in China are compliant with local laws and regulations, which may be interpreted and enforced in ways that are different from our interpretation, and/or create obligations on us that are costly to meet or conflict with laws in other jurisdictions.
As we disclose to our hosts and guests regarding China, we are subject to various requirements and requests from government agencies to share information on users who use or offer services in China through our platform. Failure to comply with such requests or other requirements as interpreted by government agencies may lead to impairment or disruption to our business and operations, including failing to obtain or losing the necessary licenses to operate in China, the blocking of our platform and services in China, and/or enforcement action against our host community, corporate entities or officers. Our failure to comply with such requests or requirements, or conversely our compliance with such requests or requirements, could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, given that our headquarters is in the United States, any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.-China bilateral relations or escalation of geo-political risk in China could adversely affect our business.
In China, the Chinese government has adopted regulations that govern the dissemination of content over the Internet, and China’s first cybersecurity law (“CSL”) took effect in June 2017. The CSL and related regulations and implementation measures are continuing to develop, and it is uncertain what obligations will apply to us in the future. In particular, the CSL imposes high requirements for the operational security of facilities, including data localization requirements, for operators deemed to be part of the “critical information infrastructure.” However, the definition of “critical information infrastructure” is not precise, and there are substantial uncertainties as to its ultimate interpretation and whether it applies to us. Chinese regulators are also considering additional regulation restricting the transfer of personal data and important data outside of China, and we could become subject to data localization requirements in the future as a result of this regulation and/or newly-published industry-specific rules and regulations. If we are considered as an operator of “critical information infrastructure,” or if we become subject to restrictions under other measures or data localization requirements under other Chinese laws and regulations, we would incur substantial costs to comply or have to change our business practices in a manner that materially adversely affects our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Actions by the U.S. government could also impair our ability to effectively operate in China, including through the use of Executive Orders or trade blacklists to ban or limit the use of services provided by Chinese third parties.
We conduct our business in China through a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and a wholly-foreign owned entity. We do not own shares in our VIE and instead rely on contractual arrangements with the equity holders of our VIE to operate our business in China because foreign investment is restricted or prohibited. Under our contractual arrangements, we must rely on the VIE and the VIE equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the VIE. The VIE equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our stockholders, and they may not act in our best interests or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. If our VIE or its equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may not be able to enforce our rights. In addition, if the Chinese government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to our VIE do not comply with Chinese governmental restrictions on foreign investment, or if these regulations or their interpretation changes in the future, we could be subject to penalties, be forced to cease our operations in China, or be subject to restrictions in the future, and we may incur additional compliance costs. The contractual arrangements with our VIE may also be subject to scrutiny by the Chinese tax authorities and any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes.
We track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We track certain operational metrics, including metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, active listings, active bookers, hosts, and guest arrivals, which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations globally.
Our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period. However, cancellations and alterations for bookings made in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period. This results in a reported amount of Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the quarter of the booking for which all of the bookings may ultimately not result in check-ins, and subsequently reduces our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics in subsequent quarters when we experience cancellations. Cancellations and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the COVID-19 outbreak, as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling. While the number of nights and experiences canceled in January 2020 was 13% of the gross nights and experiences booked that month, the number of nights and experiences canceled in March and April 2020 exceeded the number of gross nights and experiences booked during those months. If we experience high levels of cancellations in the future, our performance and related business metrics will be materially adversely affected.
The calculation of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings may require future adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings.
An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of hosts with an available listing as of a certain date. Some individuals may have more than one host account and therefore may be counted more than once as hosts.
Our metrics, including our reported Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, may include fraudulent bookings, accounts, and other activities that have not been flagged by our trust and safety teams or identified by our machine learning algorithms or not yet addressed by our operational teams, which could mean these activities on our site are not identified or addressed in a timely manner or at all, reducing the accuracy of our metrics. Further, any such fraudulent activity, along with associated refunds and cancellations, would reduce our metrics, in particular Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, in the quarter in which it is discovered. Limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operational metrics are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, we may be subject to stockholder litigation, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our efforts to create new offerings and initiatives are costly, and if we are unable to successfully pursue such offerings and initiatives, we may fail to grow, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
We need to continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives that differentiate us from our competitors, such as Airbnb Experiences. Developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity, and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives.
Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such offerings and initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. It is also possible that offerings developed by others will render our offerings and initiatives noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, these efforts entail investments in our systems and infrastructure, payments platform, and increased legal and regulatory compliance expenses, could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources
from our more established offerings and geographies. Even if we are successful in developing new offerings and initiatives, regulatory authorities may subject us or our hosts and guests to new rules, taxes, or restrictions or more aggressively enforce existing rules, taxes, or restrictions, that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing these initiatives. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, we may fail to grow and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. As part of host and guest registration and business processes, we collect and use personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card or other financial information that hosts and guests provide to us. The laws of many states and countries require businesses that maintain such personal data to implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used.
For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual (“personal data”), and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties, and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance.
Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting on the ways in which our business can use personal data. Many large geographies, which are important to our success, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
In addition, from January 1, 2021 (when the transitional period following Brexit expired), we are subject to the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, both regimes having the ability to fine up to the greater of 20 million Euros (17 million British Pounds) or 4% of global turnover, respectively. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example, how data transfers between EU member states and the United Kingdom will be treated and the role of the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office with respect to the European Union. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the European Union and UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, while the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from European Union member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions; for example, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it noted that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances; this has created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations.
In addition to other mechanisms (particularly standard contractual clauses), we previously relied on our own Privacy Shield certification and, in limited instances, the Privacy Shield certifications of third parties (for example, vendors and partners) for the purposes of transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. We continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the EEA, including to the United States. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we rely on derogations provided for by law. These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and, or, receive personal data transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. As our lead supervisory authorities (the Irish Data Protection Commission, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection and, until the end of 2020, the British ICO), the European Data Protection Board, and other data protection regulators issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
In the United States, federal law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) and its implementing regulations, restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. Numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents’ personal
data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to access and delete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The law also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes severe statutory damages as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. The CPRA and the CCPA may lead other states to pass comparable legislation, with potentially greater penalties, and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business. The effects of the CPRA, the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.
Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts news laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with GDPR, GLBA, CCPA, and other privacy regulations around the world, many of these regulations expose us to the possibility of material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Furthermore, to improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities may expose us to the risk of regulatory enforcement from privacy regulators and civil litigation.
When we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including tax authorities, state and city regulators, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence agencies, our hosts, guests, and privacy regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws, which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions. Conversely, if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action from such government, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our business also increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and automated decision making to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our customers. However, in recent years use of these methods has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. New laws, guidance and/or decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our artificial intelligence models, or require us to make changes to our operations that may decrease our operational efficiency, result in an increase to operating costs and/or hinder our ability to improve our services. For example, there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under the GDPR that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Further, California recently introduced a law requiring disclosure of chatbot functionality.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), laws, rules, and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity, and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
If we fail to prevent data security breaches, there may be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our platform, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
There are risks of security breaches both on and off our systems as we increase the types of technology we use to operate our platform, including mobile apps and third-party payment processing providers, and as we collaborate with third parties that may need to process our host or guest data or have access to our infrastructure. The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against. An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to criminal enterprises or nation-state actors. While we take significant measures to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breaches, the techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and
often are unknown until launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics and techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Further, with a large geographically disparate employee base, we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider compromising our information systems and infrastructure. This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have a distributed community support organization including third-party providers that have access to personal information. We and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insiders exfiltrating the personal data of customers, stealing corporate trade secrets and key financial metrics, and illegally diverting funds. No series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat.
In addition, bad actors have targeted and will continue to target our hosts and guests directly with attempts to breach the security of their email accounts or management systems, such as through phishing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from our hosts or guests, partners, or vendors. We have seen many instances of our hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes, which result in their accounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud against them, other users, and our platform. Bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our hosts or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing hosts and guests and attract new hosts and guests. The ability of fraudsters to directly target our hosts and guests with fraudulent communications, or cause an account takeover, exposes us to significant financial fraud risk, including costly litigation, which is difficult to fully mitigate.
Generally, our practice is to encrypt certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest. However, we do not know whether our current practice will be deemed sufficient under applicable laws or whether new regulatory requirements might make our current practice insufficient. Moreover, the existence of encryption, in-and-of itself, is not a completely perfect security solution. If there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that certain personal data has been exfiltrated, accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform the host or guest whose data was stolen, accessed, or used, and may be subject to significant fines and penalties. Further, under certain regulatory schemes, such as the CCPA, we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis, irrespective of any actual damages or harm to the individual. This means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amounting to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions of dollars.
Our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic intrusions that our security measures may not detect. We have experienced security incidents in the past, and we may face additional attempted security intrusions in the future. Any circumvention of our security measures could result in the misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, interrupt our operations, result in financial loss, damage our computers or those of our hosts and guests, or otherwise cause damage to our reputation and business. Further, the ability to bypass our information security controls could degrade our trust and safety programs, which could expose individuals to a risk of physical harm or violence.
We rely on third-party service providers, including financial institutions, to process some of our data and that of our hosts and guests, including payment information, and any failure by such third parties to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or disclosure of, such information could have adverse consequences for us similar to an incident directly on our systems.
We have acquired and will continue to acquire companies that are vulnerable to security breaches, and we are responsible for any security breaches of these newly acquired companies. While we conduct due diligence of these companies, we do not have access to the full operating history of the companies and cannot be certain there have not been security breaches prior to our acquisition.
We expend, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to protect against security related incidents and address problems caused by such incidents. Even if we were to expend more resources, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient, and regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mitigated. We have a heightened risk of security breaches due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions. Any actual or alleged security breaches or alleged violations of federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations relating to privacy and data security could result in mandated user notifications, litigation, government investigations, significant fines, and expenditures; divert management’s attention from operations; deter people from using our platform; damage our brand and reputation; force us to cease operations for some length of time; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputation harm. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any specific claim, or any change or cessation in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our platform is highly complex, and any undetected errors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and software. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform and to effectively implement updates to our systems. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code have not been and may not be discovered until after the code has been released. We have, from time to time, found defects or errors in our system and software limitations that have resulted in, and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in, platform unavailability or system disruption, or the inability of our systems to implement timely updates that are required for regulatory compliance. For example, defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to hosts or overpaying or
underpaying hosts, which would impact our cash position and may cause hosts to lose trust in our payment operations. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems released to production or found in third-party software, including open source software, that is incorporated into our code, any misconfigurations of our systems, or any unintended interactions between systems could result in poor system performance, an interruption in the availability of our platform, incorrect payments, inadvertent failure to effectively comply with legal or regulatory requirements, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of existing and potential hosts and guests, loss of revenue, liability for damages, a failure to comply with certain legal or tax reporting obligations, and regulatory inquiries or other proceedings, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
System capacity constraints, system or operational failures, or denial-of-service or other attacks could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Since our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. If our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new offerings and tiers. It may be particularly difficult for us to manage these issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related governmentally mandated shelter at home orders, as a result of which few, if any, of our employees are physically present in our headquarters.
Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in San Francisco, built on a high-risk liquefaction zone and is near major earthquake fault lines. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, computer viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and similar events. In addition, Northern California has recently experienced, and may continue to experience power outages during the fire season and our headquarters does not have power generator backup to maintain full business continuity. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our headquarters, any third-party cloud hosting facilities, or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruptions or delays of our platform and services.
Our systems and operations are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct from external sources and malicious insiders. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. There are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware, and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful attacks could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged. We have experienced system failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our community support team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in community support costs, and harm our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While we have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems, these steps are expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our platform, including transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair our transaction and payment processing systems, financial and accounting systems, and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and depending on the systems affected, our transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our business depends on the performance and reliability of the Internet, mobile, telecommunications network operators, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices, we also become dependent on consumers’ access to the Internet through mobile carriers and their systems. Disruptions in Internet access, whether generally, in a specific region or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state, and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions
against our hosts and guests. In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect and remit taxes on behalf of our hosts. We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct and indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in dispute with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied.
The application of indirect taxes, such as lodging taxes, hotel, sales and use tax, privilege taxes, excise taxes, VAT, goods and services tax, harmonized sales taxes, business tax, and gross receipt taxes (together, “indirect taxes”) to e-commerce activities such as ours and to our hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue. Some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting, collection, and payment of such taxes, and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. New or revised foreign, federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our hosts and guests to additional indirect, income, and other taxes, and depending upon the jurisdiction could subject us or our hosts and guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non-payment of taxes. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering adopting or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including digital platform revenue-based taxes, targeting online sharing platforms and online marketplaces, and new obligations to collect host income taxes, sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on digital platforms. We may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax liabilities, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We accrue a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is probable that such taxes apply to us, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient.
New or revised taxes and, in particular, the taxes described above and similar taxes would likely increase the price paid by guests, the cost of doing business for our hosts, discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and lead to a decline in revenue, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes, our hosts, guests, and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us. If we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments. Our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors. This uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use OTAs, hotels, or other traditional travel services. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. The application of indirect taxes to our hosts, guests, and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit taxes. Even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools, we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion, in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change, which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation, and result in enforcement actions and litigation. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly to our business and results of operations. Certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully compliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, tiers or features, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our hosts and guests will further change and evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which may include more frequent or severe storms, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts and wildfires, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which may include more frequent or severe storms, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts, and wildfires, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our hosts’ properties and result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our hosts find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs for our hosts, including the cost of water or energy, and requiring our hosts to expend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other climate-related issues, our hosts may decide to remove their listings from our platform. If we are unable to provide listings in certain areas due to climate change, we may lose both hosts and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations, which make it difficult to forecast our future results.
Our results of operations may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. We experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. We experience seasonality in our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV, and seasonality in Adjusted EBITDA that is consistent with seasonality of our revenue, which has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins as it is the peak travel season for North America and EMEA. We recognize revenue upon the
completion of a check-in. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. In addition to seasonality, our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•reduced travel and cancellations due to other events beyond our control such as health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, other epidemics and pandemics, natural disasters, wars, regional hostilities or law enforcement demands and other regulatory actions;
•periods with increased investments in our platform for existing offerings, new offerings and initiatives, marketing, and the accompanying growth in headcount;
•our ability to maintain growth and effectively manage that growth;
•increased competition;
•our ability to expand our operations in new and existing regions;
•changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business;
•changes to our internal policies or strategies;
•harm to our brand or reputation; and
•other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. Moreover, we base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates for revenue that may turn out to be inaccurate. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We currently rely on a number of third-party service providers to host and deliver a significant portion of our platform and services, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our platform and services, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We rely primarily on Amazon Web Services in the United States and abroad to host and deliver our platform. Third parties also provide services to key aspects of our operations, including Internet connections and networking, data storage and processing, trust and safety, security infrastructure, source code management, and testing and deployment. In addition, we rely on third parties for many aspects of our payments platform and a significant portion of our community support operations are conducted by third parties at their facilities. We also rely on Google Maps and other third-party services for maps and location data that are core to the functionality of our platform, and we integrate applications, content, and data from third parties to deliver our platform and services.
We do not control the operation, physical security, or data security of any of these third-party providers. Despite our efforts to use commercially reasonable diligence in the selection and retention of such third-party providers, such efforts may be insufficient or inadequate to prevent or remediate such risks. Our third-party providers, including our cloud computing providers and our payment processing partners, may be subject to intrusions, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, and other misconduct. They are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our platform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to our competitors. If we are unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses, or costs to remediate any of these deficiencies. Our systems currently do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing or payment processing. Although we are in the process of developing a comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans for all of our operations, there is no guarantee that such plans will be effective. The occurrence of any of the above events could result in hosts and guests ceasing to use our platform, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may raise additional capital in the future or otherwise issue equity, which could have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock. As a result, our stockholders may experience immediate dilution. We may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when option holders exercise their right to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans, when RSUs vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity.
Should we require additional funding, we cannot be sure that it will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
The coverage afforded under our insurance policies may be inadequate for the needs of our business or our third-party insurers may be unable or unwilling to meet our coverage requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary established in 2019, to manage the exposures related to our business operations. We support our host community by maintaining a variety of host protection programs, including Host Protection Insurance, Experience Protection Insurance, and our Host Guarantee Program. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our expectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail to pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided; or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages. Our overall spend on insurance has increased as our business has grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a reasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our costs for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve. Furthermore, as our business continues to develop and diversify, we may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving offerings and tiers, which could require us to incur greater costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, if we fail to comply with insurance regulatory requirements in the regions where we operate, or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Host Protection Insurance and Experience Protection Insurance
In order to offset our potential exposure related to stays and experiences and to comply with certain short-term rental regulatory requirements, we have procured Host Protection and Experience Protection general liability insurance from third parties, which are subject to certain terms, conditions, and exclusions, for claims from guests and third parties for bodily injury or property damage arising from bookings of stays and experiences through our platform. We and our hosts are insured parties, and landlords, homeowners or condo-owners associations, and any other similar entities, are additional insured parties. However, these insurance programs may not provide coverage for certain types of claims, including those relating to contagious diseases such as COVID-19, and may be insufficient to fully cover costs of investigation, costs of defense, and payments or judgments arising from covered claims. In addition, extensive or costly claims could lead to premium increases or difficulty securing coverage, which may result in increased financial exposure and an inability to meet insurance regulatory requirements.
Corporate Insurance
We procure insurance policies to cover various business and operations-related risks that are normal and customary and available in the current insurance market, including general business liability, workers’ compensation, cyber liability and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, and property insurance. We do not have sufficient coverage for certain catastrophic events, including certain business interruption losses, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, certain policies may not be available to us and the policies we have and obtain in the future may not be sufficient to cover all of our business exposure.
Captive Insurance Company
We have a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary to manage the financial exposure related to our host and experiences protection insurance programs along with certain corporate insurance programs. Our captive insurance subsidiary is a party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a portion of the risk from our insurance providers to the captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves. As our business continues to develop and diversify, we may choose to or have to transfer more risk to our captive insurance subsidiary as it may become more difficult to obtain insurance with current retentions or deductibles and with similar terms to cover our exposure. Our insurance reserves account includes unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses for risks, and other associated expenses, such as defense costs retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary. These amounts are based on third-party actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While these reserves are believed to be adequate, our ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Host Guarantee Program
We maintain a Host Guarantee Program that provides reimbursement of up to $1 million for loss or damages to a host property caused by guests, subject to terms and conditions. While the Host Guarantee Program is a commercial agreement with our hosts and for which we are primarily responsible, we maintain a contractual liability insurance policy to provide coverage to us for claims and losses incurred by us under the Host Guarantee Program. Increased claim frequency and severity and increased fraudulent claims could result in greater payouts, premium increases, and/or difficulty securing coverage. Further, disputes with hosts as to whether the Host Guarantee Program applies to alleged losses or damages and the increased submission of fraudulent payment requests could require significant time and financial resources.
Our community support function is critical to the success of our platform, and any failure to provide high-quality service could affect our ability to retain our existing hosts and guests and attract new ones.
Our ability to provide high-quality support to our community of hosts and guests is important for the growth of our business and any failure to maintain such standards of community support, or any perception that we do not provide high-quality service, could affect our ability to retain and attract hosts and guests. Meeting the community support expectations of our hosts and guests requires significant time and resources from our community support team and significant investment in staffing, technology, including automation and machine learning
to improve efficiency, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools. The failure to develop the appropriate technology, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools, or to manage or properly train our community support team, could compromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively. The number of our hosts and guests has grown significantly and such growth, as well as any future growth, will put additional pressure on our community support organization and our technology organization. In addition, as we service a global customer base and continue to grow outside of North America and Europe, we need to be able to provide effective support that meets our hosts’ and guests’ needs and languages globally at scale. As part of our reduction in force announced in May 2020, we significantly reduced the number of employees in our community support organization and our technology organization, which impacted our ability to provide effective support to our hosts and guests. Our service is staffed based on complex algorithms that map to our business forecasts. Any volatility in those forecasts could lead to staffing gaps that could impact the quality of our service. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience backlog incidents that lead to substantial delays or other issues in responding to requests for customer support, which may reduce our ability to effectively retain hosts and guests.
The vast majority of our community support is performed by a limited number of third-party service providers. We rely on our internal team and these third parties to provide timely and appropriate responses to the inquiries of hosts and guests that come to us via telephone, email, social media, and chat. Reliance on these third parties requires that we provide proper guidance and training for their employees, maintain proper controls and procedures for interacting with our community, and ensure acceptable levels of quality and customer satisfaction are achieved.
We provide community support to hosts and guests and help to mediate disputes between hosts and guests. We rely on information provided by hosts and guests and are at times limited in our ability to provide adequate support or help hosts and guests resolve disputes due to our lack of information or control. To the extent that hosts and guests are not satisfied with the quality or timeliness of our community support or third-party support, we may not be able to retain hosts or guests, and our reputation as well as our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
When a host or guest has a poor experience on our platform, we may issue refunds or coupons for future stays. These refunds and coupons are generally treated as a reduction to revenue, and we may make payouts for property damage claims under our Host Guarantee Program, which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and is also generally treated as a reduction in revenue. A robust community support effort is costly, and we expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as we grow our business. We have historically seen a significant number of community support inquiries from hosts and guests. Our efforts to reduce the number of community support requests may not be effective, and we could incur increased costs without corresponding revenue, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
A significant portion of our bookings and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies, and our financial results are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates.
A significant portion of our business is denominated and transacted in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign exchange risk. We offer integrated payments to our hosts and guests in over 40 currencies. Generally speaking, U.S. dollar strength adversely impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated. We also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effects of exchange rates on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $134.1 million due to fluctuations in exchange rates and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the host elects to get paid. In those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the host payment due to timing differences in such payments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net foreign currency gains of $31.5 million in our consolidated statement of operations. While we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure in the future, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
The value of our equity investments in private companies could decline, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our equity investments in private companies where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes, with such changes in value recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for our equity investments in private companies where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, we record our proportionate share of net income or loss in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. The financial statements provided by these companies are often unaudited. Our investments in private companies are inherently risky, including early-stage companies with limited cash to support their operations and companies whose results are negatively impacted by downturns in the travel industry, such as the one currently occurring. The companies in which we invest include early-stage companies that may still be developing products and services with limited cash to support the development, marketing and sales of their products. Further, our ability to liquidate such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, as no public market currently exists for the securities held in the investees. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of a liquid market for the securities of such companies. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we will recognize an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. We recorded impairment charges of $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to investments in private companies, and may experience similar or
greater losses on our investments in the future. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.
Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and determine the value of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. For example, our 2008 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2016 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposes an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. If we are not able to resolve the proposed adjustment at the IRS examination-level, we plan to pursue all available administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies which may include: entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“IRS Appeals”) in 2021, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court’s decision to the appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a restructuring plan to repatriate our intellectual property to the United States to align with our evolving operations in a post COVID-19 environment. The restructuring plan involved numerous intercompany arrangements and tax jurisdictions and required the valuation of multiple intercompany transactions which could be challenged by respective tax authorities, including as a result of reduced valuations caused by forecast adjustments due to the impact of COVID-19, and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are currently under a multilateral control (“MLC”) audit where a number of individual European state audits are combined. The MLC audit is focused on VAT characterization and compliance, access to host data, and transfer pricing. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The determination of our worldwide provision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Changes in accounting for intercompany transactions may also affect our effective tax rate. For example, with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16, effective January 1, 2018, the income tax effects of an intercompany transfer are recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs, rather than amortized over time, which may increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in a particular period. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax expense could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in the United States and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. We may also be subject to additional tax liability relating to indirect or other non-income taxes, as described in our risk factor titled “- Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.” Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income (including indirect) taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in Altera Corp. v.
Commissioner in June of 2019 regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement, which had a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the quarter in which the decision was issued. In addition, on December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a transition to a more territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of this legislation on our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was a reduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate. Since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets, these changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the impact of the Tax Act will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, the issuance of which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period issued. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains certain tax provisions, including provisions that retroactively and/or temporarily suspend or relax in certain respects the application of certain provisions in the Tax Act, such as the limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and interest. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a 2017 law requires short-term rental platforms that process payments to collect and remit host income tax and tourist tax, amongst other obligations. Airbnb has challenged this law before the Italian courts but if we are unsuccessful this will lead to further compliance and potentially significant prior and future tax obligations.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued a report in 2015 and an interim report in 2018, and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income (including indirect) taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others, have each proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on digital platforms and would likely apply to our business.
The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax law provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. Due to the large and increasing scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above and in our risk factor titled “- Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform” could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income (including indirect) taxes imposed on our business, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $116.7 million and $5.1 billion, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to expiration will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2034. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $167.6 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2033. We generated significant stock compensation deductions as a result of our initial public offering starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, which substantially increased the size of our net operating loss carryforwards. While federal net operating loss carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration, the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.
Our business depends on attracting and retaining capable management and employees, and the loss of any key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and employees. Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk founded our company and have been instrumental in devising and implementing our strategies for growth and scaling our business. Our founders and other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. Our business requires highly skilled technical, engineering, design, product, data analytics, marketing, business development, and community support personnel, including executive-level employees, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified
employees and executive-level employees is intense in our industry and particularly in San Francisco where we have our headquarters and other jurisdictions where we operate. The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow.
To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our programs or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past. We have a number of current employees, including our founders, who hold equity in our company or whose equity awards are or became substantially vested upon the completion of our initial public offering. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions about whether or not they continue to work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. If we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted.
In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020,
we announced a reduction in force of approximately 1,800 employees. This has led to increased attrition and could lead to reduced employee morale and productivity and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Consumer use of devices and platforms other than desktop computers creates challenges. If we are unable to operate effectively on these platforms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
People regularly access the Internet through mobile phones, tablets, handheld computers, voice-assisted speakers, television set-top devices, smart televisions, wearables, and automobile in-dash systems. These devices enable new modalities of interaction, such as conversational user interfaces, and new intermediaries, such as “super-apps” like WeChat, where consumers can use many online services without leaving a particular app. We anticipate that the use of these means of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computers will continue to decline, especially in certain regions of the world experiencing the highest rate of Internet adoption. The functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices, such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop computer, lower the use of our platform, and make it more difficult for our hosts to upload content to our platform. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices, and it is uncertain how the proliferation of mobile devices will impact the use of our platform and services. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services meaning that such consumers may opt to use one of our competitors’ services instead of ours. As a result, brand recognition and the consumer experience with our mobile app will likely become increasingly important to our business. In addition, these new modalities create opportunities for device or systems companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, to control the interaction with our consumers and disintermediate existing platforms such as ours.
We need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address latency issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices. Because our platform contains data-intensive media, these issues are exacerbated. As new devices, operating systems, and platforms continue to be released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our offerings and features.
Our success will also depend on the interoperability of our offerings with a range of third-party technologies, systems, networks, operating systems, and standards, including iOS and Android; the availability of our mobile apps in app stores and in “super-app” environments; and the creation, maintenance, and development of relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which may also be our competitors. In addition, if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions, the full functionality of devices may not be available to our customers. Moreover, third-party platforms, services and offerings are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties. If we lose such interoperability, we experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems, or manufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings, make changes that degrade the functionality of our offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, the growth of our community and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. This risk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices. In the event consumers choose devices that do not already include or support our platform or do not install our mobile apps when they change or upgrade their devices, our traffic and host and guest engagement may be harmed.
If we are unable to adapt to changes in technology and the evolving demands of hosts and guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new offering announcements, introductions, and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. In 2018, we began making incremental investments in upgrading our technology platform to a service-oriented architecture, improving data management, and increasing our service reliability, and we invested heavily in our technology in 2019. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of hosts and guests. Our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization, cryptocurrencies, new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and cloud technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our technologies and platform; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful. For example, we may not make the appropriate investments in new technologies, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and other
system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Another critical component to our future success will be our ability to integrate new or emerging payment methods into our platform to offer alternative payment solutions to consumers. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many regions, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternate payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers.
We are subject to payment-related fraud and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud, fraudulent activities, fictitious transactions, or illegal transactions would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. When hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests, there are fictitious listings or fraudulent bookings on our platform, or there are host account takeovers, we have incurred and will continue to incur losses from claims by hosts and guests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a “chargeback.” For the year ended December 31, 2020, total chargeback expense was $124.7 million. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth in certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically-knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable chargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards, or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of charge-backs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our payments platform is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, transactions in violation of economic and trade sanctions, corruption and bribery, terrorist financing, fraudulent listings, host account takeovers, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. Use of our payments platform for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests, which could result in liability and reputational harm for us. We have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activities, but these measures need to be continually improved and may add friction to our booking process. These measures may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activities, particularly new and continually evolving forms of circumvention. If these measures do not succeed in reducing fraud, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
Our payments platform is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; stored value and prepaid access; foreign exchange; privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity; banking secrecy; payment services (including payment processing and settlement services); consumer protection; economic and trade sanctions; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing. As we expand and localize our international activities, we have and will become increasingly subject to the laws of additional countries or geographies. In addition, because we facilitate bookings on our platform worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating our payments platform outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.
We have assessed, and will continue to assess, the adequacy of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including the ones described below. Through these assessments, we have identified, and may in the future identify, certain gaps or weaknesses in our existing compliance programs, including in our policies, procedures, or internal controls. As a result of findings from these assessments, we have, are, and may in the future take certain actions, such as implementing enhancements to our compliance measures and amending, updating, or revising our policies, procedures, and internal controls, and other operational frameworks, designed to monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance. Implementing appropriate measures to fully remediate or address findings from assessments of our compliance programs may require us to incur significant costs.
Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, or orders of any governmental authority, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, and increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. In addition, we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices, make product changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. The complexity of global regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions, and have an adverse impact on, or result in the termination of, our relationships with financial institutions and other service providers on whom we rely for payment processing services. Our ability to track and verify transactions to comply with
these regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, require a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls could result in reputational harm and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators.
Payments Regulation
In the United States, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Airbnb Payments, Inc. (“Airbnb Payments”), is registered as a “Money Services Business” with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), and subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement by FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “BSA”). Airbnb Payments has also obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in various states and territories where such licenses are required. As a licensed money transmitter, Airbnb Payments is subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the handling and investment of customer funds, record keeping and reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In U.S. states and territories in which Airbnb Payments has not obtained a license to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), we may be required to apply for licenses or regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations.
We issue gift cards in the United States for use on our platform and are subject to consumer protection and disclosure regulations relating to those services. If we seek to expand our gift cards or other stored value card products and services, or as a result of regulatory changes, we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations, which we may not be able to obtain.
We principally provide our payment services to hosts and guests in the EEA through Airbnb Payments Luxembourg SA (“APLux”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a payments institution in Luxembourg. EEA laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EEA, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. For example, countries that are EEA members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the European Union Payment Services Directive, the Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”), the E-Money Directive, and the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives. Further, we provide our payments services to hosts and guests in the United Kingdom and other geographies outside the United States and the EEA through Airbnb Payments UK Limited (“APUK”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as an electronic money institution (“EMI”) in the United Kingdom, as well as through our other wholly-owned payments entities.
PSD2 imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction. These authentication requirements were originally scheduled to commence in September 2019, but European national supervisory authorities delayed enforcement until January 1, 2021, and they will go into force in the United Kingdom on September 14, 2021. In many cases, strong customer authentication requires our European guests to engage in additional steps to authenticate payment transactions and European hosts to perform authentication upon access to their payout account or modification of their payout account information. These additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for hosts and guests in the European Economic Area substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which our customers use our platform or could cause some hosts and guests to stop using our platform entirely, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In many countries or geographies, it is and may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, electronic money institution, financial institution, or otherwise. In such instances, we partner with local banks and licensed payment processors to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may slow or halt payments to hosts conducted through local banks and licensed payment processors or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. We may be required to apply for various additional licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals.
There are substantial costs and potential changes to our offerings involved in obtaining, maintaining, and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals globally. Our payments entities are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision, and regulation by each relevant regulating authority, including, within the United States, by each state in which Airbnb Payments is licensed. We could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance and internal controls, risk management, privacy, data protection and data localization, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other laws and requirements, including those imposed on United Kingdom EMIs and Luxembourg payments institutions. These factors could involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our offerings or services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing our offerings or services in a given geography.
Consumer Protection
We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the U.S. states and countries from which we provide payment services. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB. Money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments are subject to direct supervision and periodic examination by the CFPB and are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer,
among other requirements. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures.
We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the CFPB or other agencies. The CFPB’s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs.
We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal privacy laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. See our risk factor titled “- If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
In addition to United Kingdom and Luxembourg payments-related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business, regulators in European Union member states could notify APUK and APLux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses, and could also seek to persuade the United Kingdom and Luxembourg regulators to order APUK or APLux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in European Union countries.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing
We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA. Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses (including money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. The BSA prohibits, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers. Regulators in the United States and globally may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. In the European Union, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (“MLD4”) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with MLD4 could include fines of up to 10% of APUK’s or APLux’s total annual turnover. In April 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (“MLD5”), containing more stringent provisions in certain areas, which will increase compliance costs. In July 2019, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) called on UK electronic money institutions to review their compliance with the requirements on safeguarding of customer funds and to notify the FCA in the event they identified any material non-compliance. APUK notified the FCA that it had identified gaps in its compliance and was undertaking remedial action. The FCA, in turn, appointed a third-party skilled person to perform a review of APUK’s safeguarding systems and controls, in accordance with Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) and all required actions identified by the skilled person were completed. The FCA closed the skilled persons review in August 2020. As part of its review, the skilled person also identified certain issues with APUK’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems and controls. In August 2020, APUK submitted a gap analysis to the FCA of its compliance with the UK’s implementation of MLD4 and MLD5, which identified in-progress remedial action. To date, APUK has received no correspondence related to this gap analysis from the FCA.
We are subject to governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that limit the scope of our offering. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability and negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate, including the U.S. government (including without limitation regulations administered and enforced by OFAC and the U.S. Department of State), the Council of the European Union, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of Her Majesty’s Treasury in the United Kingdom (“OFSI”) and the Ministry of Finance and Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of Luxembourg. These economic and trade sanctions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries, regions, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN List”), subject to EU/UK asset freezes, or other sanctions measures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls. We maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls, which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps. We routinely report to OFAC on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations. We have also reported to OFSI on dealings with persons subject to EU/UK
sanctions. There is a risk that, despite the internal controls that we have in place, we have engaged in dealings with persons sanctioned under applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we may be required to make additional investments in our internal controls or modify our business.
Beginning in July 2019, we conducted an internal review and have been holding related discussions with OFAC regarding certain user activity on our platform that may have been inconsistent with our policies and the requirements of U.S. sanctions laws. The scope of this review included activity by users in certain countries and territories that were or are the target of U.S. sanctions laws. In July 2020, OFAC issued to us a cautionary letter and no administrative penalty with respect to certain aspects of that review concerning the Crimea region of Ukraine. The internal review also covered certain other issues concerning our compliance with OFAC’s sanctions program, focusing in particular on our business in Cuba, and as to our compliance with restrictions on transactions with specially designated nationals. We submitted the results of that internal review in final Voluntary Self Disclosures to OFAC in September 2020. In October 2020, OFAC issued to us cautionary letters and a no action letter, and no administrative penalties, with respect to the disclosed matters involving specially designated nationals. OFAC’s review of our voluntary self disclosure regarding Cuba is ongoing and we remain in close contact with OFAC. Depending upon OFAC’s assessment of the Cuba review, we could be subject to potentially significant monetary civil penalties and litigation, and our brand and reputation could be materially adversely affected.
We are subject to payment network rules and any material modification of our payment card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the “PCI DSS”). Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationship with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or misuse of the credit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges.
We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Like the payment networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which can require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems.
We rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to hosts on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to hosts on our platform. We have agreements with these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service.
If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted, we would need to find an alternate payment service provider, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment service provider in an acceptable time frame. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by our hosts and guests. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant losses and, in certain cases, require us to make payments to hosts out of our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In addition, the software and services provided by our third-party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to hosts on our platform, which could make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests.
Moreover, our agreements with payment service providers may allow these companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash as a reserve. They may be entitled to a reserve or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our business, results of operations, and financial condition. An imposition of a reserve or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If we fail to invest adequate resources into the payment processing infrastructure on our platform, or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable, our payments activities may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings, which could adversely impact their usage. Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support these activities. As we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographies or offer new payment methods to our hosts and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses.
For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card network costs have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks, and may impose special fees or assessments on any such transaction. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We offer integrated payments in over 40 currencies to allow access to guest demand from more than 220 countries and regions and the ability for many hosts to be paid in their local currency or payment method of choice. When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. treasury bills and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings and tiers, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses or be unable to process payment transactions.
We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, including certificates of deposit, highly-liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, mutual funds, and bank loan funds, with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad for both our corporate balances and for funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests. We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
The failure to successfully execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have acquired multiple businesses, including our April 2019 acquisition of Hotel Tonight, Inc. and our August 2019 acquisition of UrbanDoor Inc., and we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal. In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
In addition, we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions or the businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. While our acquisitions to date have not caused major disruptions in our business, any future failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays, and failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies;
•failure of the acquired businesses to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow;
•diversion of management’s attention or other resources from our existing business;
•our inability to maintain the key customers, business relationships, suppliers, and brand potential of acquired businesses;
•uncertainty of entry into businesses or geographies in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger positions;
•unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions or greater than expected costs in integrating the acquired businesses;
•responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, including those that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates, such as liabilities arising out of the failure to maintain effective data protection and privacy controls, and liabilities arising out of the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws;
•difficulties in or costs associated with assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries the acquired companies’ intellectual property or its licenses to third-party intellectual property;
•inability to maintain our culture and values, ethical standards, controls, procedures, and policies;
•challenges in integrating the workforce of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;
•challenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with GAAP; and
•potential accounting charges to the extent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as trademarks, customer relationships, or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.
Because we recognize revenue upon check-in and not at booking, upticks or downturns in bookings are not immediately reflected in our results of operations.
We experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which occurs upon check-in. The effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods because of this timing in revenue recognition. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are making certain payments to hosts and issuing guest cancellation coupons to guests, which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and result in a reduction to revenue.
If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and our data, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We hold a broad collection of intellectual property rights related to our brand; certain content and design elements on our platform; inventions related to our platform, services, and research and development efforts; an extensive repository of wholly-owned audio and visual assets; marketing and promotional concepts and materials; a collection of editorial content; and certain entertainment-related assets. This includes registered domain names, registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, patents and patent applications, trade secrets, licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds, and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States and in a number of countries around the world. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents, trademarks, domain name registrations, and copyrights from third parties. In the future we may acquire or license additional patents or patent portfolios, or other intellectual property assets and rights from third parties, which could require significant cash expenditures.
We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, international treaties, our terms of service, other contractual provisions, user policies, restrictions on disclosure, technological measures, and confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property assets from infringement and misappropriation. Our pending and future trademark, patent, and copyright applications may not be approved. Furthermore, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. There can be no assurance that others will not offer technologies, products, services, features, or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business, or copy or otherwise obtain, disclose and/or use our brand, content, design elements, creative, editorial, and entertainment assets, or other proprietary information without authorization. We may be unable to prevent third parties from seeking to register, acquire, or otherwise obtain trademarks, service marks, domain names, or social media handles that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and our other proprietary rights. Third parties have also obtained or misappropriated certain of our data through website scraping, robots, or other means to launch copycat sites, aggregate our data for their internal use, or to feature or provide our data through their respective websites, and/or launch businesses monetizing this data. While we routinely employ technological and legal measures in an attempt to divert, halt, or mitigate such operations, we may not always be able to detect or halt the underlying activities as technologies used to accomplish these operations continue to rapidly evolve.
Our intellectual property assets and rights are essential to our business. If the protection of our proprietary rights and data is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our technologies, offerings, or features or methods of operations. Even if we do detect violations or misappropriations and decide to enforce our rights, litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights, and any enforcement efforts we undertake could be time-consuming and expensive, could divert our management’s attention, and may result in a court determining that certain of our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and data in a cost-effective and meaningful manner, our competitive standing could be harmed; our hosts, guests, other consumers, and corporate and
community partners could devalue the content of our platform; and our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that we or others violated certain third-party intellectual property rights, which, even where meritless, can be costly to defend and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The Internet and technology industries are characterized by significant creation and protection of intellectual property rights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of such intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and applications of the foregoing, that they allege cover significant aspects of our platform, technologies, content, branding, or business methods. Moreover, companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequent targets of practicing and non-practicing entities seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses. Like many other companies in the Internet and technology industries, we sometimes enter into agreements which include indemnification provisions related to intellectual property which can subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.
We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed, misused, or otherwise misappropriated their intellectual property rights, including alleged patent infringement. Additionally, we have been, and may in the future be, involved in claims, suits, regulatory proceedings, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights, or relating to our intellectual property holdings and rights. While a number of the infringement claims raised against us have been based on our use or implementation of third-party technologies for which those third parties have been required to defend against the claims on our behalf and indemnify us from liability, intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. See Part 1, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal and Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Claims involving intellectual property could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using certain technologies, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our ability to compete and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may introduce new offerings or changes to existing offerings or make other business changes, including in areas where we currently do not compete, which could increase our exposure to patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights claims from competitors, other practicing entities, and non-practicing entities. Similarly, our exposure to risks associated with various intellectual property claims may increase as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired a company or technology that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition.
Our use of “open source” software could adversely affect our ability to offer our platform and services and subject us to costly litigation and other disputes.
We have in the past incorporated and may in the future incorporate certain “open source” software into our code base as we continue to develop our platform and services. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, which in some instances may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. In addition to using open source software, we also license to others some of our software through open source projects. Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of open source software or compliance with open source license terms. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms.
While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our proprietary source code, inadvertent use of open source software is fairly common in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to unforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our product which incorporate the software, being required to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms, or being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes, including in areas where we do not currently compete. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the value or enforceability of our intellectual property, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and any violation of anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws in the United States and elsewhere that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials, political parties, state-owned or controlled enterprises, and/or private entities and individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations in and deal with countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, contractors, agents, or users that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in these countries. We have implemented policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to discourage corrupt practices by our employees, consultants, and agents, and to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations; however, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and we cannot ensure that all such parties, including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. or other laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible. Additional compliance requirements may require us to revise or expand our compliance programs, including the procedures we use to monitor international and domestic transactions. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations may result in extensive internal or external investigations as well as significant financial penalties and reputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our focus on the long-term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, hosts, guests, employees, the communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders that we may identify from time to time, may conflict with short- or medium-term financial interests and business performance, which may negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock.
We believe that focusing on the long-term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, hosts, guests, employees, the communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders we may identify from time to time, is essential to the long-term success of our company and to long-term shareholder value. Therefore, we have made decisions, and may in the future make decisions, that we believe are in the long-term best interests of our company and our shareholders, even if such decisions may negatively impact the short- or medium-term performance of our business, results of operations, and financial condition or the short- or medium-term performance of our Class A common stock. Our commitment to pursuing long-term value for the company and its shareholders, potentially at the expense of short- or medium-term performance, may materially adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock, including by making owning our Class A common stock less appealing to investors who are focused on returns over a shorter time horizon. Our decisions and actions in pursuit of long-term success and long-term shareholder value, which may include changes to our platform to enhance the experience of our hosts, guests, and the communities in which we operate, including by improving the trust and safety of our platform, changes in the manner in which we deliver community support, investing in our relationships with our hosts, guests, and employees, investing in and introducing new products and services, or changes in our approach to working with local or national jurisdictions on laws and regulations governing our business, may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the trading price of our Class A common stock, could be materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
Our share price may be volatile, and the value of our Class A common stock may decline.
The market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and others beyond our control, including:
•the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the travel and accommodations industries;
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue or other operating metrics;
•our actual or anticipated operating performance and the operating performance of our competitors;
•changes in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;
•failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;
•any major change in our board of directors, management, or key personnel;
•the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;
•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, new products, services, features, integrations, or capabilities, acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;
•the legal and regulatory landscape and changes in the application of existing laws or adoption of new laws that impact our business, hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy and tax laws;
•legal and regulatory claims, litigation, or pre-litigation disputes and other proceedings;
•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and
•sales or expected sales of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, directors, principal stockholders, and employees.
In addition, stock markets, and the trading of travel companies’ and technology companies’ stocks in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including travel companies and technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our Class A common stock following our recent initial public offering as a result of the supply and demand forces for newly public companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of stock volatility. If we were to
become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The multi-series structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain holders of our common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates, who held in the aggregate 59.6% of the voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2020. This ownership will limit or preclude other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.
Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, our Class C common stock has no votes per share, and our Class H common stock has no votes per share. As of December 31, 2020, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock beneficially owned 79.5% of our outstanding capital stock and held 98.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owning 48.5% of our outstanding capital stock and holding 59.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively held 42.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest.
Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock.
We cannot predict the effect our multi-series structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
We cannot predict whether our multi-series structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices, including the S&P 500. Accordingly, the multi-series structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Because of the multi-class structure of our common stock, we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur in large quantities, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had 115,499,875 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, 483,697,162 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, no shares of Class C common stock outstanding, and 9,200,000 shares of Class H common stock outstanding.
As of immediately following the closing of our initial public offering in December 2020, the holders of up to 453,853,793 shares of our common stock, options to purchase 13,788,876 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase 7,934,794 shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. Any
registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.
Further, as of December 31, 2020, we had 41,420,645 options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of 27,631,769 shares of Class A common stock and 13,788,876 shares of Class B common stock, as well as 47,754,231 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon vesting of outstanding RSUs, which have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements, compliance by affiliates with Rule 144, and other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan and/or the award agreements entered into with participants. In addition, we filed a registration statement and may in the future file registration statements covering shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans permitting the resale of such shares by non-affiliates in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act and the sale by affiliates in the public market subject to compliance with the resale provisions of Rule 144.
We and all of our directors, executive officers, and certain other record holders that together represent approximately 80% of our outstanding Class A common stock and securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A common stock, calculated as of immediately prior to our initial public offering, are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering or market standoff agreements with us that restrict their ability to transfer such shares of Class A common stock and such securities, including any hedging transactions, during the period ending on the later of (i) the opening of trading on the second trading day immediately following our public release of earnings for the first quarter of 2021 and (ii) the 121st day after December 9, 2020.
In addition, substantially all of the remaining approximately 20% of our outstanding Class A common stock and securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A common stock, including equity awards issued under our equity incentive plans, calculated as of immediately prior to our initial public offering, are subject to market standoff agreements with us that restrict certain transfers of such shares of Class A common stock and such securities during the restricted period. Notwithstanding the terms of such market standoff agreements, our insider trading policy prohibits hedging by all of our current directors, officers, employees and independent contractors. In addition to shares of our Class A common stock previously sold into the market to cover employee tax liability upon the vesting of equity awards, up to approximately 33.5 million shares of our Class A common stock and securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A common stock may be sold beginning at the opening of trading on March 1, 2021, which is the second trading day immediately following our public release of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, pursuant to the terms of the lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering.
Upon the expiration of the restricted period described above, substantially all of the securities subject to such lock-up and market standoff restrictions will become eligible for sale, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may waive the lock-up agreements and market standoff agreements entered into by our executive officers, directors, and record holders of our securities before they expire.
Sales, short sales, or hedging transactions involving our equity securities, whether before or after our initial public offering and whether or not we believe them to be prohibited, could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.
Record holders of our securities are typically the parties to the lock-up agreements with the underwriters and to the market standoff agreements with us referred to above, while holders of beneficial interests in our shares who are not also record holders in respect of such shares are not typically subject to any such agreements or other similar restrictions. Accordingly, we believe that holders of beneficial interests who are not record holders and are not bound by market standoff or lock-up agreements could enter into transactions with respect to those beneficial interests that negatively impact our stock price. In addition, an equityholder who is neither subject to a market standoff agreement with us nor a lock-up agreement with the underwriters may be able to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or attempt to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of their equity interests at any time.
In November 2020, we issued 9,200,000 shares of our Class H common stock to our Host Endowment Fund and we have announced our intention to donate 400,000 shares of our Class A common stock to a charitable foundation, each of which has resulted or will result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance and any issuance of Class A common stock upon the conversion of Class B or Class H common stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. See also our risk factor titled “ - Future sales and issuances of our Class A common stock or rights to purchase our Class A common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, or other equity securities or securities convertible into our Class A common stock, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the stock price of our Class A common stock to decline.”
Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. Any future issuance of Class C common stock may have the effect of further concentrating voting control in our Class B common stock, including the Class B common stock held by our founders, and may discourage potential acquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.
Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. Although we have no current plans to issue any shares of Class C common stock, we may in the future issue shares of Class C common stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including financings, acquisitions, investments, and equity incentives to our employees, consultants, and directors. Our authorized but unissued shares of Class C common stock are available for issuance with the approval of our board of directors without stockholder approval, except as may be required by the Listing Rules of Nasdaq. Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class
C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate 48.5% of our outstanding capital stock but held in the aggregate 59.6% of the voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2020. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support, and could allow us to take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class B common stock. Any such issuance of Class C common stock could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change their recommendations regarding our company, and our stock price could decline.
Future sales and issuances of our Class A common stock or rights to purchase our Class A common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, or other equity securities or securities convertible into our Class A common stock, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the stock price of our Class A common stock to decline.
In the future, we may sell Class A common stock, other series of common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities, including preferred securities, in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We also expect to issue Class A common stock to employees, consultants, and directors pursuant to our equity incentive plans. If we sell Class A common stock, other series of common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, or Class A common stock or Class B common stock is issued pursuant to equity incentive plans, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.
In addition, we made an initial contribution of 9,200,000 newly-issued shares of Class H common stock to the Host Endowment Fund in November 2020 and may in our discretion make additional contributions of Class H common stock in the future, and any future issuances of Class H common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. However, it is our current intent that the total number of shares contributed to the Host Endowment Fund by us, when aggregated with any prior contributions, will not exceed 2% of our total shares outstanding at the time of any future contribution. We have also announced our intention to donate 400,000 shares of our Class A common stock to a charitable foundation.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our Class A common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our Class A common stock increases.
We have only paid one dividend in our history and do not intend to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation and growth of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Furthermore, our Credit Agreements contain negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. For more information, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and Delaware law contains provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. These provisions provide for the following:
•a multi-series structure which provides our holders of Class B common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock, and Class H common stock;
•a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, who can only be removed for cause, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;
•the exclusive right of our board of directors to set the size of the board of directors and to elect a director to fill a vacancy, however occurring, including by an expansion of the board of directors, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
•the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including voting or other rights or preferences, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;
•the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;
•in addition to our board of director’s ability to adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders may adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all our then-outstanding shares of capital stock;
•the required approval of (i) at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and (ii) for so long as any shares of Class B common stock are outstanding, the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding at the time of such vote, voting as a separate series, to adopt, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation;
•the ability of stockholders to act by written consent only as long as holders of our Class B common stock hold at least 50% of the voting power of our capital stock;
•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by an officer of our company pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors then in office or the chairperson of our board;
•advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and
•the limitation of liability of, and provision of indemnification to, our directors and officers.
These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware General Corporation Law”), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.
Any provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered or intend to enter into with our directors and officers provide that:
•we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful;
•we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;
•we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers will undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;
•the rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and
•we may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents.
While we have procured directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies, such insurance policies may not be available to us in the future at a reasonable rate, may not cover all potential claims for indemnification, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide, that: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company, (B) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder to the company or our stockholders, including without limitation a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (C) any action asserting a claim
against the company or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (D) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions; and (iv) failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law.
We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.
The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the company, which may discourage such claims against us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the company and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim.
General Risk Factors
The value of our marketable securities could decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our marketable securities portfolio includes various holdings, types, and maturities. Market values of these investments can be adversely impacted by various factors, including liquidity in the underlying security, credit deterioration, the financial condition of the credit issuer, foreign exchange rates, and changes in interest rates. Our marketable securities, which we consider highly-liquid investments, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and other than-temporary impairments are reported within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
If the fair value of our marketable equity securities declines, our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased. Furthermore, our interest income from cash, cash equivalents, and our marketable securities are impacted by changes in interest rates, and a decline in interest rates would adversely impact our interest income.
We will incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Stockholder activism and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional significant compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The increased costs will increase our net loss or decrease our net income, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase our service fees which could result in a reduction in bookings. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.
Further, the majority of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have either no or limited experience in managing publicly-traded companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
As a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner,
or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock and your investment.
As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations will require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s initial certification under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be required with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2021. In support of such certifications, we will be required to document and make significant changes and enhancements, including potentially hiring additional personnel, to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. As a result, we anticipate investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures.
To date, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we identify or fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence, which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with a revision to previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the provision for income taxes resulting from the incorrect use of tax attributes. We identified that the cause of the income tax provision adjustment was a lack of qualified tax personnel with an appropriate level of experience to review the use of tax attributes in accordance with tax ordering rules. While we remediated this material weakness as of December 31, 2018 through hiring additional experienced personnel, we can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased probability of fraud, the potential loss of customers, litigation from our stockholders, reduction in our ability to obtain financing, and require additional expenditures to remediate. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and a decline in our stock price, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
The failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In the third quarter of 2019, we implemented a new third-party revenue accounting system in order to automate our revenue accounting and reporting processes. System implementations of this scale are complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and financial processes. Such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. Additionally, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.
The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel.
Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations.
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and neither do we intend to own investment securities with a combined value in excess of 40% of the value, as determined by our board of directors, of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time
that may be deemed investment securities. We expect to conduct our operations such that the value of those investments will not rise to a level where we might be deemed an investment company, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining the required ratios without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Item 2.","Item 2. Properties
We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, where we have lease commitments for approximately 948,000 square feet, including approximately 170,000 square feet offered for sublease, across multiple buildings. As of December 31, 2020, we leased office facilities totaling approximately 1.9 million square feet in multiple locations in the United States and internationally. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs.
Item 3.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. These include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property rights. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal and Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
These matters also include the following:
•On November 23, 2020, an individual plaintiff filed a complaint asserting patent and trade secrets claims against Airbnb, Inc. in the Northern District of California. The patent at issue relates to a method of reflecting a place to stay listing in a geospatial environment. The complaint asserts direct and indirect infringement and willfulness. We intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.
Depending on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, we may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes, we believe based on our current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Use of Proceeds
On December 14, 2020, we completed our IPO, in which we sold 55.0 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price to the public of $68 per share, which included 5.0 million shares of Class A common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the option to purchase additional shares. The offer and sale of the shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-250118), which was declared effective by the SEC on December 9, 2020. We raised approximately $3.7 billion in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $79.3 million and offering expenses of $9.8 million. We have used a portion of the net proceeds, and intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, from our IPO to satisfy the tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of our outstanding RSUs in connection with our IPO totaling approximately $1.6 billion, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds we received from our IPO to acquire or make investments in businesses, products, offerings, and technologies, although we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at this time.
In connection with the offering, 1,323,531 shares of Class A common stock were sold by existing stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by these stockholders nor did we bear direct costs associated with the sale of these shares.
The representatives of the underwriters of our IPO were Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. No payments were made by us to directors, officers, or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates, other than payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries and to non-employee directors pursuant to our director compensation policy.

Overview
Airbnb is a community based on connection and belonging-a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to 4 million hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. Airbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive.
Our Business Model
We operate a global marketplace, where hosts offer guests stays and experiences on our platform. Our business model relies on the success of hosts and guests who join our community and generate consistent bookings over time. As hosts become more successful on our platform and as guests return over time, we benefit from the recurring activity of our community.
We experienced rapid growth since our founding through 2019. In 2019, we generated GBV of $38.0 billion, representing growth of 29% from $29.4 billion in 2018, and revenue of $4.8 billion, representing growth of 32% from $3.7 billion in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our business was materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with GBV of $23.9 billion, down 37% year over year, and revenue of $3.4 billion, down 30% year over year. We expect continued volatility in these trends and fluctuations from month to month as the continued impact from COVID-19 is not linear across geographies and as COVID-19 is continuing to materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
Initial Public Offering
Our IPO was completed on December 14, 2020. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended reflect the sale by us of an aggregate of 55,000,000 shares in our IPO, including the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares, at the public offering price of $68.00 per share, for net proceeds to us of approximately $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and the conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 240,910,588 shares of Class B common stock, including 1,286,694 shares of Class B common stock issuable pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions relating to our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended include stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion associated with the vesting of RSUs in connection with our IPO for which the requisite service-based vesting condition was met as of December 31, 2020. The liquidity-based vesting condition for RSUs was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement on December 9, 2020.
Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We track the following key business metrics and financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”) to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided under the subsection titled “- Adjusted EBITDA” and “- Free Cash Flow” below.
Key Business Metrics
We review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies that may calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.
Nights and Experiences Booked
Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking were canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform.
In 2020, we had 193.2 million Nights and Experiences Booked, a 41% decrease from 326.9 million Nights and Experiences Booked in 2019, which in turn was a 31% increase from 250.3 million Nights and Experiences Booked in 2018. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new hosts and guests to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. Our Nights and Experiences Booked declined from prior levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in 2020 was most severe in the second quarter, with Nights and Experiences Booked declining 67% from the prior year period, and our business improved from those levels in the third and fourth quarters with declines of 28% and 39%, respectively, from the prior year period. This improvement was driven by stronger results in North America and Europe, in particular with resilience in domestic and short-distance travel, with more people gravitating toward Airbnb stays within driving distance of their homes.
Gross Booking Value
GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred during that period. The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled “- Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Nights and Experiences Booked” above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program.
Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. In 2020, our GBV was $23.9 billion, a 37% decrease from $38.0 billion in 2019, which in turn was a 29% increase from $29.4 billion in 2018. The decrease in our GBV in 2020 was due to the reduction in Nights and Experiences Booked due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above. On a constant currency basis, the reduction in GBV was 37%. The decline was most severe in the second quarter, with GBV declining 67% from the prior year. We experienced an increase in GBV in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as domestic travel rebounded on our platform from
the second quarter levels, but below third and fourth quarter 2019 levels by 17% and 31%, respectively. In the third and fourth quarters of 2020, GBV declined less than Nights and Experiences Booked as a result of increased GBV per Night and Experience Booked driven by a shift towards North America compared to other regions and entire home bookings.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided below. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
The following table summarizes our non-GAAP financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each period presented below.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for (benefit from) income taxes; (ii) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense and stock-settlement obligations related to the IPO; (v) acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; (vi) net changes to the reserves for lodging taxes for which management believes it is probable that we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes; and (vii) restructuring charges.
The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting.
Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, for which management believes it is probable that we may be held jointly liable with hosts in certain jurisdictions, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included in the subsection titled “-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Lodging Tax Obligations,” as well as the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:
•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense) and other income (expense), net, which include unrealized and realized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, investments, and financial instruments, including the warrants issued in connection with a term loan agreement entered into in April 2020;
•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
•Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy as well as stock-settlement obligations, which represent employer and related taxes related to the IPO;
•Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. The contingent consideration, which was in the form of equity, was valued as of the
acquisition date and is mark-to-market at each reporting period based on factors including our stock price. The changes in fair value of contingent consideration was insignificant prior to the fourth quarter of 2020;
•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect net changes to reserves for lodging taxes for which management believes it is probable that we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes; and
•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring charges, which include severance and other employee costs, lease impairments, and contract amendments and terminations.
Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results.
In 2020, Adjusted EBITDA was $(250.7) million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 of $(253.3) million, primarily due to the reduction in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above, partially offset by a reduction in overall spend. In 2019, Adjusted EBITDA was $(253.3) million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 of $170.6 million, primarily due to significant investments in growth initiatives and investments in our technical infrastructure in 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation
The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss:
(1)Excludes stock-based compensation related to restructuring, which is included in restructuring charges in the table above.
Free Cash Flow
We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations, after purchases of property and equipment, that can be used for investment in our business and for acquisitions as well as to strengthen our balance sheet. Our Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests and amounts payable to our hosts and guests do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Free Cash Flow does not reflect our ability to meet future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
In 2020, Free Cash Flow was $(667.1) million compared to $97.3 million in 2019, representing 2% of revenue, and $504.9 million in 2018, representing 14% of revenue in 2018. Free Cash Flow decreased in 2020 due to the reduction in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above, partially offset by cost reductions. Free Cash Flow decreased in 2019 largely due to higher operating expenses, while it increased in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher operating income and to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditures.
Free Cash Flow Reconciliation
The following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
COVID-19 Has Had a Disproportionately Negative Effect on the Travel Industry
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease was first reported. Only three months later, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced international, federal, state, and local governments to enforce prohibitions of non-essential activities. The outbreak will have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and has already triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the depth and breadth of which are yet to be determined.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in global travel restrictions and a corresponding significant reduction in travel. While many industries have been adversely impacted, travel has been disproportionately affected, as governments have implemented travel restrictions and as people have become reluctant to travel irrespective of such restrictions.
Prior to the outbreak, we had seen strong year-over-year growth in Nights and Experiences Booked in the first three weeks of 2020. We first saw the impact of COVID-19 in China in the last week of January, which when contained to China, had a minor impact on the entire business. The outbreak spread throughout Asia, and then through Europe, North America, and the rest of the world by the end of the first quarter of 2020. In order to protect our business from these near-term market disruptions and the prospect of a prolonged business impact, we raised $2.0 billion in the form of term loans in April 2020 and took action to dramatically reduce our operating expenses as described below. We believe these incremental funds and our rapid management of expenses, in addition to our existing cash position, has helped and will continue to help us to prudently manage our business through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows remains uncertain. Our financial results for 2020 were materially adversely affected, and we expect that COVID-19 will continue to materially impact our bookings, revenue, and business operations in future periods. While we experienced an increase in GBV and revenue in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 as domestic travel rebounded, both were down compared to the same periods in 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infections emerged. As a result, countries imposed strict lockdowns. Similar to the impact of the initial COVID-19 wave in March 2020, we saw a decrease in bookings in the most affected regions. As a result, while the fourth quarter GBV and revenue were greater than the second quarter, there were greater year-over-year declines in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general, and on our business in particular.
Multiple Resilient Categories Were Less Impacted and Showed Strong Recovery
We believe that the recovery in GBV that we experienced in the second half of 2020 was attributable to the renewed ability and willingness for guests to travel, the resilience of our hosts, and relative strength of our business model. From December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2020, active listings remained stable at approximately 5.6 million despite the decline in booking activity on our platform due to COVID-19. Against an otherwise highly negative travel backdrop, there are several areas of our business that have shown resilience, notably, domestic travel, short-distance travel, travel outside of our top 20 cities, and long-term stays. While we believe that travel will change as a result of
COVID-19, the adaptability of our business suggests that we are well-positioned to serve this dynamic market as it continues to evolve and recover.
COVID-19 Cost Reductions Helped Position Our Business for Improved Financial Performance
In response to the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting material decrease in GBV, we undertook an internal review of our cost structure, ultimately making changes to improve the strength of our business in the long term. Specifically, we significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs in 2020, which we believe will result in improved operating leverage as we emerge from COVID-19. In 2020, we rapidly made changes to manage our expenses in a period of material business interruption, which included suspending substantially all discretionary marketing program spend, reducing full-time employee headcount by approximately 25%, and suspending all facilities build-outs and significantly reducing capital expenditures.
These headcount reductions and other restructuring actions resulted in charges of $151.4 million for 2020. In conjunction with these actions, we have realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual hosts and brand marketing, while pausing our investments in newer areas such as transportation and content and reducing performance marketing. We have done this to sharpen our focus on investments that directly strengthen our community and to increase the efficiency of our operations as the travel industry begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these changes should allow us to more effectively manage our business and improve our financial operating results.
Geographic Mix
Our operations are global, and certain trends in our business, such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, revenue, GBV per Night and Experience Booked, and Nights per Booking vary by geography.
We measure Nights and Experiences Booked by region based on the location of the listing. As a result of COVID-19, the geographic mix of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and revenue during 2020 reflected a shift toward North America, which saw the strongest recovery in the second half of the year. For 2020, Nights and Experiences Booked were 75.5 million, or 39% of the total, in North America compared to 67.7 million, or 35%, in EMEA, 27.6 million, or 14%, in Asia Pacific, and 22.4 million, or 12%, in Latin America. For 2020, GBV was $13.2 billion, or 55% of the total, in North America compared to $6.6 billion, or 28%, in EMEA, $2.4 billion, or 10%, in Asia Pacific, and $1.7 billion, or 7%, in Latin America. Similarly, for 2020, revenue was $1.8 billion, or 53% of the total, in North America compared to $1.0 billion, or 30%, in EMEA, $0.3 billion, or 10%, in Asia Pacific, and $0.3 billion, or 7%, in Latin America.
We saw an increase in GBV per Night and Experience Booked in 2020 compared to 2019, in part because our geographic mix shifted to these higher GBV per Night and Experience Booked regions. North America saw an increase in GBV per Night and Experience Booked as larger entire homes have been in greater demand. The average nights per booking also increased globally 2020, reflecting demand for longer stays. Specifically, GBV per Night and Experience Booked in 2020 was $174.43 for North America compared to $98.41 for EMEA, $85.83 for Asia Pacific, and $75.74 for Latin America, with a total global GBV per Night and Experience Booked of $123.69. Average nights per booking, excluding experiences, for 2020 were 4.4 nights for each of North America, EMEA, and Latin America and 2.8 nights for Asia Pacific, with a total average of 4.1 nights. We expect that our blended global average nights per booking will fluctuate based on our geographic mix and changes in traveler behaviors.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second,
and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and EMEA. Our business metrics, including GBV and Adjusted EBITDA, can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically negative. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme.
In 2020, we saw COVID-19 overwhelm the historical patterns of seasonality in our GBV, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow as a result of travel restrictions and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this impact on seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19 is impacting travel patterns globally.
Regulations Permitting or Limiting Our Offerings
Regulations that permit or limit our hosts’ ability to provide their listings impact our growth and penetration in certain geographies. In particular, among other regulations governing our short-term rentals, many large cities have placed night caps on short-term rentals of certain types of properties, limited short-term rentals to primary residences, or limited the length of a stay. No single city represented more than 1.1% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 1.2% of our active listings as of December 31, 2020. An increase in short-term rental regulations could harm our business and negatively impact our financial performance. See the section titled “Risk Factors - Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business may limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue consists of service fees, net of incentives and refunds, charged to our customers. We consider both hosts and guests to be our customers. For stays, service fees, which are charged to customers as a percentage of the value of the booking, excluding taxes, vary based on factors specific to the booking, such as booking value, the duration of the booking, geography, and host type. For experiences, we only earn a host fee. Substantially all of our revenue comes from stays booked on our platform. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities.
We experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which occurs upon check-in. We record the service fees that we collect from customers prior to check-in on our balance sheet as unearned fees. Revenue is net of incentives and refunds provided to customers totaling $221.5 million, $274.5 million, and $384.2 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, representing 6%, 6%, and 11% of revenue, respectively. The elevated level of incentives and refunds provided to customers during the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to payments made to support hosts impacted by increased guest cancellations and COVID-19 related guest cancellation coupons.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes payment processing costs, including merchant fees and chargebacks, costs associated with third-party data centers used to host our platform, and amortization of internally developed software and acquired technology. Because we act as the merchant of record, we incur all payment processing costs associated with our bookings, and we have chargebacks, which arise from account takeovers and other fraudulent activities. We expect our cost of revenue will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. Cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from year to year based on activity on our platform and may also vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of revenue based on the seasonality of our business and the difference in the timing of when bookings are made and when we recognize revenue.
Operations and Support
Operations and support expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees associated with community support provided via phone, email, and chat to hosts and guests; customer relations costs, which include refunds and credits related to customer satisfaction and expenses associated with our host protection programs; and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. We expect that operations and support expense will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. We also expect operations and support to increase in the near-term as a percentage of revenue, as we continue to invest in trust and safety programs. We are also investing in the near-term in initiatives to reduce customer contact rates and improve the operational efficiency of our operations and support organization, which we expect will decrease operations and support expense as a percentage of revenue over the longer term. We incurred additional operations and support expense during 2020, the year in which we completed our IPO, as a result of the stock-based compensation expense associated with our RSUs as described in the subsection titled “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Stock-Based Compensation-Restricted Stock Units,” and anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense going forward.
Product Development
Product development expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees incurred in connection with the development of our platform, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. We expect that our product development expense will increase on an absolute dollar basis and will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in product development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our technology platform and other programs, including the hiring of personnel to support these efforts. We incurred additional product development expense during 2020, the year in which we completed our IPO, as a result of the stock-based compensation expense associated with our RSUs as described in the subsection titled “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Stock-Based Compensation-Restricted Stock Units,” and anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense going forward.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of brand and performance marketing, personnel-related expenses, including those related to our field operations, policy and communications, portions of referral incentives and coupons, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. We expect our sales and marketing expense will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future, and over the long term, we expect it will decline as a percentage of revenue relative to 2019. We expect that sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the first half of 2021 will be higher than that of the second half. This is partially due to the marketing campaign that we are running in the first half of 2021 in advance of the summer travel season. We incurred additional sales and marketing expense during 2020, the year in which we completed our IPO, as a result of the stock-based compensation expense associated with our RSUs as described in the subsection titled “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Stock-Based Compensation-Restricted Stock Units,” and anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense going forward.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses for management and administrative functions, including finance and accounting, legal, and human resources. General and administrative expense also includes certain professional
services fees, general corporate and director and officer insurance, allocated costs for facilities and information technology, indirect taxes, including lodging tax reserves for which we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and bad debt expense. We expect to incur additional general and administrative expense as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Listing Rules of Nasdaq, as well as higher expenses for corporate insurance, director and officer insurance, investor relations, and professional services. Overall, we expect our general and administrative expense will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future. We incurred additional general and administrative expense during 2020, the year in which we completed our IPO, as a result of the stock-based compensation expense associated with our RSUs as described in the subsection titled “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Stock-Based Compensation-Restricted Stock Units,” and anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense going forward.
Restructuring Charges
Restructuring charges primarily consist of costs associated with a global workforce reduction in May 2020, lease impairments, and costs associated with amendments and terminations of contracts, including commercial agreements with service providers.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts held on behalf of customers.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of expense related to financing lease obligations in 2018 before the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), interest associated with various indirect tax reserves, amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our $1.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “2016 Credit Facility”), as well as interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our term loan agreements entered into in April 2020.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances, the change in fair value of investments and financial instruments, including the warrants issued in connection with a term loan agreement entered into in April 2020, and our share of income or loss from our equity method investments.
Our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the host elects to be paid. As a result, in those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the host payment due to timing differences in such payments. In 2019, we began entering into derivative contracts to offset a portion of our exposure to the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effects of these derivative contracts are reflected in other income (expense), net.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit developments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and losses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.
We have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and intangible assets. We expect to maintain these valuation allowances until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States and Ireland. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $116.7 million and $5.1 billion, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2034. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $167.6 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2033.
In the event that we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through December 31, 2020. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a permanent limitation on the existing tax attributes under Section 382, although subsequent changes in our ownership structure may create such a limitation.
We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposes an increase to our U.S. taxable income that
could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We intend to vigorously contest the IRS’s proposed adjustment, including through all administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies which may include: entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“IRS Appeals”) in 2021, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court’s decision to the appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:
(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:
The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue:
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020
Revenue
2020 Compared to 2019. Revenue decreased $1.4 billion, or 30%, in 2020 compared to 2019, almost entirely due to a 41% decrease in the number of Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a 6% increase in GBV per Night and Experience Booked. Service fees as a percentage of booking value, exclusive of taxes, remained relatively flat compared to the same prior year period. Also, contributing to the change was a $109.7 million increase in the reductions to revenue recorded for payments to hosts and coupons issued to guests resulting from elevated cancellations related to COVID-19. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 30% compared to 2019.
2019 Compared to 2018. Revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 32%, in 2019 compared to 2018, almost entirely due to a 33% increase in the number of check-ins related to Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform. GBV per Night and Experience Booked and service fees as a percentage of booking value, exclusive of taxes, remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 35% compared to 2018.
Cost of Revenue
2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue decreased $320.3 million, or 27%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to a $236.8 million decrease in payment processing costs, consisting of merchant fees and chargebacks and a $87.9 million decrease in the cost of data hosting services. In 2020 and 2019, payment processing costs totaled $600.2 million and $837.0 million, respectively, which represented 3% and 2% of GBV, respectively. The decrease in payment processing costs resulted from the decreased dollar value of
payments processed through our platform attributable to COVID-19 and lower payment processing fees. The decrease in data hosting resulted from lower usage and demand charges.
2019 Compared to 2018. Cost of revenue increased $332.3 million, or 38%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The change was primarily due to a $193.0 million increase in payment processing costs, consisting of merchant fees and chargebacks, a $90.2 million increase in the cost of data hosting services, and a $29.4 million increase in spend with other third-party service providers and technologies to support our platform. In 2019 and 2018, payment processing costs totaled $837.0 million and $644.0 million, respectively, which represented 2% of GBV for both periods. The increase in payment processing costs resulted from the increased dollar value of payments processed through our platform associated with the growth in GBV, while increases in data hosting and third-party service providers resulted from the associated growth in traffic on our platform. A portion of our increase in data hosting services was related to costs associated with our migration to a service-oriented architecture.
Operations and Support
2020 Compared to 2019. Operations and support expense increased $62.8 million, or 8%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to a $139.9 million increase in personnel-related expenses, predominantly comprised of stock-based compensation related to RSUs, for which the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO, and a $34.0 million increase in insurance costs, partially offset by a $53.7 million decrease in spending on third-party community support personnel and a $57.4 million decrease in customer relations costs. The decrease in spending on third-party community support personnel and customer relations costs was largely the result of decline in GBV and associated check-ins in the period due to COVID-19.
2019 Compared to 2018. Operations and support expense increased $205.9 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The change was primarily due to a $125.8 million increase in spending on third-party community support personnel, a $33.0 million increase in customer relations costs, a $21.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses, and a $15.9 million increase in allocated costs for facilities and information technology, which are allocated based on headcount. The increase in spending on third-party community support personnel and customer relations costs was largely the result of growth in GBV and associated check-ins in the period.
Product Development
2020 Compared to 2019. Product development expense increased $1.8 billion, or 182%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to a $1.8 billion increase in personnel-related expenses, predominantly comprised of stock-based compensation related to RSUs, for which the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO.
2019 Compared to 2018. Product development expense increased $397.5 million, or 69%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The change was primarily due to a $271.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in product development headcount as we invested in existing offerings, new initiatives, including our China offering, Airbnb Experiences, Airbnb Plus, hotels, and Airbnb Luxe, and platform enhancements, a $58.1 million increase in allocated costs for facilities and information technology, a $26.1 million increase in spend for consultants and service providers, and a $23.0 million increase in spend for software, maintenance, and equipment. The growth in employee headcount supported our efforts to enhance the underlying architecture and scalability of our platform by upgrading our systems and moving to a new service-oriented architecture.
Sales and Marketing
2020 Compared to 2019. Sales and marketing expense decreased $446.2 million, or 28%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to a $691.7 million decrease in marketing activities and a $52.4 million decrease in expenses for third-party service providers, partially offset by a $391.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, predominantly comprised of stock-based compensation related to RSUs, for which the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO. Total brand and performance marketing decreased $661.8 million, of which $540.5 million was related to performance marketing and $121.2 million was related to brand marketing. In March 2020, driven by COVID-19, we paused our sales and marketing investments in new initiatives and our performance marketing spend. We implemented a marketing strategy that shifted our marketing mix more towards brand marketing spend and away from spending on performance marketing. Total field operations and policy expense increased $215.6 million from 2019, which included $30.9 million of changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements related to an acquisition completed in 2019.
2019 Compared to 2018. Sales and marketing expense increased $520.2 million, or 47%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The change was primarily due to a $358.8 million increase in marketing activities, a $77.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $49.2 million increase in expenses for third-party service providers, and a $15.4 million increase in allocated costs for facilities and information technology. Total brand and performance marketing increased $473.9 million, of which $314.2 million was related to performance marketing, and $159.7 million was related to brand marketing. These increases were primarily due to our efforts to optimize our performance marketing bidding and to support the expansion of our China offering, Airbnb Experiences, Airbnb Plus, hotels, and Airbnb Luxe.
General and Administrative
2020 Compared to 2019. General and administrative expense increased $437.7 million, or 63%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to a $601.9 million increase in payroll-related expenses, predominantly comprised of stock-based compensation related to RSUs, for which the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO and a $30.9 million increase in bad debt expense. These increases were partially offset by a net $117.8 million decrease in lodging and business tax expense and a $63.0 million decrease in spend for consultants and service providers. The decrease in lodging and business tax expense resulted largely from a $81.7 million reduction in our reserve for lodging taxes in jurisdictions in which management no longer believed a liability was probable following a favorable outcome in a related legal proceeding.
2019 Compared to 2018. General and administrative expense increased $217.7 million, or 45%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The change was primarily due to a $116.4 million increase in payroll-related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount as we prepared to become a public company, a $29.9 million increase in lease expense related to our build-to-suit leases due to the adoption of ASC 842 in 2019 whereby lease expense is reported as a component of costs and expenses rather than interest expense, a $28.0 million increase in bad debt expense, and a net $17.5 million increase in lodging and business tax expense.
Restructuring Charges
* Not meaningful
2020 Compared to 2019. Restructuring charges totaled $151.4 million for 2020. In May 2020, we announced a reduction in force of approximately 25% of employees, and the resulting restructuring charges primarily included severance and other employee-related costs, lease impairments, and contract amendments and terminations.
Interest Income and Expense
2020 Compared to 2019. Interest income decreased $58.8 million, or 68%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in average interest rates and our investment portfolio mix, which was largely invested in short-term, high quality bonds. Interest expense increased $161.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the interest owed on the term loans issued in April 2020.
2019 Compared to 2018. Interest income increased $19.1 million, or 29%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher invested balances and average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $16.2 million, or 62%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 842 in 2019 whereby a component of lease expense for build-to-suit leases was no longer recorded in interest expense, but rather, as a component of general and administrative expense. In 2018, we recorded $13.5 million of lease expense related to certain build-to-suit leases within interest expense.
Other Income (Expense), Net
*Not meaningful
2020 Compared to 2019. Other expense, net was $947.2 million in 2020 compared to other income, net of $13.9 million in 2019. The unfavorable change was primarily driven by $868.5 million of fair value remeasurement on our warrants issued in 2020 in connection with our second lien loan. The warrants were issued with an initial exercise price of $28.355 per share and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date as long as the warrants remain outstanding. The year-over-year change was also attributable to a $54.3 million increase of impairment charges related to non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies and a $36.7 million increase in net realized and unrealized losses on our investments. Impairment charges recorded during 2020 totaled $82.1 million. Furthermore, a $24.6 million gain related to an equity method investment that was acquired by a third party was recorded during 2019. Partially offsetting these items was a $36.3 million increase in net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains.
2019 Compared to 2018. Other income, net was $13.9 million in 2019 compared to other expense, net of $12.4 million in 2018. The change was primarily driven by $28.3 million of net realized and unrealized gains on our investments and other income and expense, including our share of income or loss from our equity method investments, as well as a $24.6 million gain related to an equity method investment that was acquired by a third party in 2019. Partially offsetting these amounts were impairment charges of $27.8 million recorded during 2019.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
2020 Compared to 2019. The benefit from income taxes totaled $97.2 million in 2020 compared to a provision for income taxes of $262.6 million in 2019. The benefit from income taxes was primarily due to the five-year net operating loss carryback provision of the CARES Act accrued for in 2020. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
2019 Compared to 2018. The provision for income taxes increased $198.7 million, or 311%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property that was previously sold to a subsidiary. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Selected Quarterly Financial Data
The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations for each of the quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. These unaudited quarterly results of operations have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information set forth in the table below reflects all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of results of operations for these periods. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future, and the results of a particular quarter or other interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. You should read the following unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations
(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:
(2)For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $868.5 million of fair value remeasurement on our warrants issued in connection with our second lien loan, the majority of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a Percentage of Revenue
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In December 2020, upon the completion of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $3.7 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $79.3 million and offering expenses of $9.8 million. We used a portion of these net proceeds to satisfy the tax withholding and remittance obligations of approximately $1.6 billion related to the settlement of our outstanding RSUs in connection with our IPO.
As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion and marketable securities of $0.9 billion, which included $1.2 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts and highly-liquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities, mutual funds, highly-liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, and certificates of deposit. These amounts do not include funds of $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins that we record separately on our balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. However, repatriation of such funds may result in additional tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances in the United States are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States.
Loan Agreements
In April 2020, we entered into a $1.0 billion First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “First Lien Credit Agreement,” and the loans thereunder, the “First Lien Loan”), resulting in proceeds of $961.4 million, net of debt discount and issuance costs. The loan is due and payable in April 2025. The underlying loan can be repaid in whole or in part prior to April 2025 at our option, subject to applicable prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums. Beginning in September 2020, we are required to repay the First Lien Loan in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Loan, with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date. Interest on the First Lien Loan is payable monthly or quarterly in arrears at our option depending on the chosen per annum interest rate equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 7.5% plus the London interbank offered rate (customarily defined, with LIBOR replacement provisions consistent with the April 2019 Alternative Reference Rates Commission recommended fallback language for syndicated loans, “LIBOR”), subject to a floor of 1%, or (ii) in the case of base rate borrowings, 6.5% plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1%, in each case subject to a floor of 2%.
In April 2020, we entered into a $1.0 billion Second Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement,” and the loans thereunder, the “Second Lien Loan”), resulting in proceeds of $967.5 million, net of debt discount and issuance costs. The loan is due and payable in July 2025. The underlying loan can be repaid in whole or in part prior to July 2025 at our option, subject to applicable prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums and the priority of lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement over any proceeds we receive from the sale of collateral. Interest on the Second Lien Loan is payable monthly or quarterly in arrears at our option depending on the chosen per annum interest rate equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 10% plus LIBOR, in each case subject to a floor of 1%, or (ii) in the case of base rate borrowings, 9% plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1%, subject to a floor of 3%. In addition, at our election, payment-in-kind interest up to 5.5% per annum may be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Second Lien Loan by such amount.
In connection with the Second Lien Loan, we issued warrants to purchase 7,934,794 shares of Class A common stock with an initial exercise price of $28.355 per share, subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain specified events, to the Second Lien Loan lenders. The warrants expire on April 17, 2030 and the exercise price can be settled in cash or in net shares at the holder’s option. The fair value of the warrants of $116.6 million at issuance was recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and the warrant liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date as long as the warrants remain outstanding and unexercised with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the warrant totaled $985.2 million, or an increase in liability of $868.5 million since their issuance in April 2020.
The First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement include customary conditions to borrowing, events of default, and covenants, including those that restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create or incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, liquidate or dissolve, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or make distributions, make acquisitions, investments, loans or advances, or payments and prepayments of junior or unsecured indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement.
2020 Credit Facility
In November 2020, we entered into a $500.0 million five-year senior secured revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), which provides for an initial borrowing commitment by a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. of $500.0 million (the “2020 Credit Facility”). The 2020 Credit Facility provides a $200.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2020 Credit Facility has a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on any undrawn amounts, payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on borrowings is equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 1.5% plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0%, or (ii) in the case of base rate borrowings, 0.5% plus the greatest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1%, in each case subject to a floor of 1%.
The Revolving Credit Agreement includes customary conditions to borrowing, events of default, and covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant requiring us to have liquidity of at least $200.0 million as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and those that restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create or incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, liquidate or dissolve, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or make distributions, subject to certain exceptions.
As of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of the borrowings outstanding under the First Lien Loan and Second Lien Loan totaled $1,995.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2020 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $21.4 million.
2016 Credit Facility
In April 2020, we terminated our 2016 Credit Facility, which provided an initial borrowing commitment by a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A. of $1.0 billion. The 2016 Credit Facility also provided a $100.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Facility had a commitment fee of 0.125% per annum on any undrawn amounts. Outstanding borrowings bore interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus one-half of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day by Bank of America as its “prime rate,” or (iii) the eurocurrency rate for one month plus 1.00%.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2016 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled $53.0 million. The 2016 Credit Facility contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes, and pay dividends or other distributions, as well as certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2019. On April 17, 2020, we terminated the 2016 Credit Facility. Certain letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Facility were transferred to new issuers upon the termination of the 2016 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit formerly under the 2016 Credit Facility totaled $32.9 million and were collateralized by $33.8 million of restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.
We believe that our current available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, ability to attract and retain hosts and guests on our platform, capital expenditures, acquisitions, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 will be higher than that of 2020, but significantly lower than 2019. The majority of our expected investments are related to office improvements in North America, many of which were delayed in 2020.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for 2020 was $629.7 million. Our net loss for 2020 was $4.6 billion, adjusted for non-cash charges, primarily consisting of $3.0 billion of stock-based compensation expense, $868.5 million of fair value remeasurement on warrants issued in connection with a term loan agreement entered into in April 2020, $125.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $107.7 million of bad debt expense, and $82.1 million of impairment charges of investments. Additional uses of cash resulted from changes in working capital, including a $267.0 million decrease in unearned fees resulting from fewer bookings on our platform due to COVID-19.
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $222.7 million. Our net loss for 2019 was $674.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges, primarily consisting of $114.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $97.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $77.1 million of bad debt expense. Additional sources of cash flows resulted from changes in working capital, including a $547.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulting from increased spending and headcount growth, as well as a $176.3 million increase in unearned fees resulting from increased bookings on our platform. The primary use of operating cash was a $186.4 million increase in prepaids and other assets associated with the growth in our operations.
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $595.6 million. Our net loss for 2018 was $16.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges, primarily consisting of $82.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $53.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $49.0 million of bad debt expense. Additional sources of cash flows resulted from changes in working capital, including a $348.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulting from increased spending and headcount growth, as well as a $145.9 million increase in unearned fees resulting from increased bookings on our platform. The primary use of operating cash was a $102.8 million increase in prepaids and other assets associated with the growth in our operations.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 was $79.6 million, which was primarily provided by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, partially offset by cash used to purchase marketable securities of $3.0 billion and property and equipment of $37.4 million.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was $347.2 million, which was primarily used to purchase marketable securities of $1.0 billion and property and equipment of $125.5 million, to fund acquisitions of $192.1 million, and to make equity investments in privately-held companies of $208.2 million. These uses were partially offset by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $609.4 million and $551.6 million, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was $668.2 million, which was primarily used to purchase marketable securities of $1.3 billion and property and equipment of $90.6 million, to fund acquisitions of $31.3 million, and to make equity investments in privately-held companies of $28.9 million. These uses were partially offset by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $555.2 million and $201.3 million, respectively.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $2.9 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds of $3.7 billion from the issuance of Class A common stock upon IPO, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, $1.9 billion from the issuance of long-term debt and warrants, net of issuance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 billion for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and $1.0 billion in funds payable and amounts payable to customers.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $854.6 million, reflecting the change in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $848.7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $5.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $140.5 million, primarily reflecting the change in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $117.6 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $16.0 million, and reimbursements for improvements we made at leased office facilities of $6.9 million.
Effect of Exchange Rates
The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. During 2020, we recorded a $134.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded a $25.3 million and a $158.9 million reduction in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our guests and hosts.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Indemnification Agreements
In the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification provisions under certain agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations of varying scope and terms. Under these contracts, we may indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with breach of the agreements, or intellectual property infringement claims made by a third party, including claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to its performance under the subject agreement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, executive officers, or employees.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:
(1)Excludes income tax matters as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
(2)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating lease obligations, excluding short-term leases. Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
(3)Noncancelable purchase commitments include amounts related to our commercial agreement with a data hosting services provider, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least $1.2 billion for vendor services through 2027.
(4)Consists of two separate loan agreements entered into in April 2020, including principal and interest. Refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Amounts represent the future principal and interest payments based on contractual interest rates.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, which we adopted as of January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis. We generate substantially all of our revenue from facilitating guest stays at accommodations offered by hosts on the Airbnb platform. We consider both hosts and guests to be our customers. Our revenue is comprised of service fees from our customers. Our single performance obligation is identified as the facilitation of a stay, which occurs upon the completion of a check-in event. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied upon check-in.
We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether or not we are the principal in the transaction (gross) or whether we arrange for other parties to provide the service to guests and are the agent (net) in the transaction. We determined that we do not control the right to use the accommodations provided by us either before or after completion of our service. Accordingly, we concluded that we are acting in an agent capacity and revenue is presented net reflecting the service fees received from our customers to facilitate a stay.
Revenue is presented net of certain payments we make to customers as part of our referral programs and marketing promotions, collectively referred to as our incentive programs, and refund activities. The payments are generally in the form of coupon credits to be applied toward future bookings or as cash refunds. We encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers through our incentive programs. Under the referral program, the referring party (“referrer”) earns a coupon when the new host or guest (“referee”) completes their first stay on our platform. We record the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Any amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the referral service received are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Through marketing promotions, we issue customer coupon credits to encourage the use of our platform. After a customer redeems such incentives, we record a reduction to revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction. From time to time, we issue refunds to customers in the form of cash or credits to be applied toward a future booking. We reduce the transaction price by the estimated amount of the payments by applying the most likely outcome method based on known facts and circumstances and historical experience. These refunds are recorded as a reduction to revenue.
We evaluate whether the cumulative amount of payments made to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service received from a customer exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the customer relationship. Any cumulative payments in excess of cumulative revenue are presented as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employees. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The fair value of stock options is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock (see the subsection titled “- Common Stock Valuations” below), are estimated as follows:
•Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method.
•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
•Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies.
•Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.
We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of our RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity-based vesting condition. In November 2019, we also began granting RSUs with a service-based vesting condition only. The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is
satisfied over four years, generally on or around each of February 25, May 25, August 25, and November 25. The liquidity-based vesting condition for RSUs was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement on December 9, 2020.
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award. Prior to our IPO in December 2020, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized for RSUs with both service-based and liquidity-based vesting conditions because the liquidity-based vesting condition had not been probable of being satisfied. Upon our IPO in December 2020, we recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was $1.0 billion, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years.
Common Stock Valuations
Subsequent to our IPO in December 2020, the fair value of common stock is determined on the grant date using the closing price of our Class A common stock.
Prior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors exercised its reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of fair value of our common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs, including:
•independent third-party valuations of our common stock;
•the prices at which others have purchased our redeemable convertible preferred stock in arm’s-length transactions;
•the rights, preferences and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;
•our financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources;
•the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions;
•the lack of marketability of our common stock;
•our estimates of future financial performance;
•valuations of comparable companies;
•the hiring or loss of key personnel;
•the status of our development, product introduction, and sales efforts;
•industry information, such as market growth and volume and macro-economic events; and
•additional objective and subjective factors relating to our business.
To determine the fair value of our common stock, we first determined our enterprise value and then allocated that enterprise value to our common stock and common stock equivalents. Our enterprise value was estimated using two generally accepted approaches: the income approach and the market approach.
The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows the business is expected to generate over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. The market approach measures the value of a business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments or assets, and in our case, focused on comparing us to a group of our peer companies. In applying this method, valuation multiples are derived from historical operating data of the peer company group. We then apply multiples to our operating data to arrive at a range of indicated values of the company.
For each valuation, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market approach. The financial forecast considered our past results and expected future financial performance. The risk associated with achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as a result of new operating data and economic and other conditions that impact our business.
As an additional indicator of fair value, we provided weighting to arm’s-length transactions involving issuances of our securities near the respective valuation dates in connection with acquisitions.
Lodging Tax Obligations
Some states, cities, and localities in the United States and elsewhere in the world impose transient occupancy or lodging accommodations taxes (“lodging taxes”) on the use or occupancy of lodging accommodations or other traveler services. We collect and remit lodging taxes in more than 29,800 jurisdictions on behalf of our hosts, and lodging taxes are primarily collected in the United States. Such lodging taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a 30 to 90-day period following the end of each month.
In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Our accrued obligations related to lodging taxes, including estimated penalties and taxes, totaled $138.4 million and $52.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and changes to this reserve are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
We are currently involved in a number of lawsuits brought by certain states and localities involving the payment of lodging taxes. These jurisdictions are asserting that we are liable or jointly liable with hosts to collect and remit lodging taxes. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to vigorously defend these claims. We believe that the statutes at issue impose a lodging tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, our hosts. The ultimate resolution of these lawsuits cannot be determined at this time.
Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions and estimates in determining our reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled through negotiation. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
The provision for (benefit from) income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities that may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for (benefit from) income taxes.
Goodwill and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We have one reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. As a result of the goodwill impairment assessment, management concluded goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 and does not believe that its reporting unit is at risk of failing the impairment test since the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value.
Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals.
Any impairments to right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are initially recognized when a decision to do so is made and recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For lease assets, such circumstances would include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $35.8 million of ROU asset impairment charges within restructuring charges in the consolidated statement of operations.
Significant judgment and estimates are required in assessing impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, estimating future cash flows, and determining appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.
Item 7A.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our substantial operations around the world expose us to various market risks. These risks primarily include foreign currency risk and investment risk.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We offer the ability to transact on our platform in over 40 currencies, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations in 2020 were the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real, and Chinese Yuan. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we are subject to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results.
We have foreign currency exchange risks related primarily to:
•revenue and cost of revenue associated with bookings on our platform denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;
•balances held as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers and funds payable and amounts payable to customers;
•unbilled amounts for confirmed bookings under the terms of our Pay Less Upfront program; and
•intercompany balances primarily related to our payment entities that process customer payments.
For revenue and cost of revenue associated with bookings on our platform outside of the United States, we generally receive net foreign currency amounts and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the host elects to be paid. As a result, in those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the host payment due to timing differences in such payments.
In 2019, we began entering into foreign currency derivative contracts to protect against foreign exchange risks. Presently, these hedges are primarily designed to manage foreign exchange risk associated with balances held as funds payable and amounts payable to customers. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.
We may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.
We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in exchange rates. If our foreign-currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses increase, our results of operations may be more significantly impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business.
If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies as of December 31, 2020, it would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related primarily to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as interest paid on our debt.
We had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion and marketable securities of $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, which consisted of corporate debt securities, mutual funds, highly-liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, and certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2020, we had an additional $2.2 billion that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins, which we record separately on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We invest primarily in highly-liquid, investment grade debt securities, and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Because our cash equivalents and marketable securities generally have short maturities, the fair value of our portfolio is relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had floating-rate loans of $1,995.0 million, subject to LIBOR floors. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent LIBOR exceeds the floors. As of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Airbnb, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Airbnb, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $507.9 million relating to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020. Management evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition, step one, occurs when management concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement, step two, determines the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company is in various stages of examination in connection with its ongoing tax audits globally and management believes that an adequate provision has been recorded for any adjustments that may result from tax audits. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, management may be required to record an adjustment to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the technical merits and the measurement of the tax positions based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of uncertain tax positions; (ii) testing the recognition and measurement of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including management’s assessment of the technical merits of the tax positions and the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained; (iii) testing the information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including intercompany agreements, international, federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax returns; (iv) evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax
authorities; and (v) evaluating third party income tax documentation obtained by the Company. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and measurement of the Company’s uncertain tax positions, including evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained and the amount of potential benefit to be realized, the application of relevant tax laws, and estimated interest and penalties.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Description of Business
Airbnb, Inc. (the “Company” or “Airbnb”) was incorporated in Delaware in June 2008 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The Company operates a global platform for unique stays and experiences. The Company’s marketplace model connects hosts and guests (collectively referred to as “customers”) online or through mobile devices to book spaces and experiences around the world.
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Stock Split
On October 26, 2020, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split of its common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented.
Initial Public Offering
The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “IPO Registration Statement”) related to its initial public offering (“IPO”) was declared effective on December 9, 2020 and the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 10, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the Company completed its IPO, in which the Company sold 50.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $68.00 per share. On the same day, the Company sold an additional 5.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $68.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $3.7 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $79.3 million and offering expenses of $9.8 million.
Upon completing the IPO, all outstanding shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock, of which 239,623,894 shares were outstanding prior to the IPO, converted into an aggregate of 240,910,588 shares of our Class B common stock, including 1,286,694 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions relating to the Company’s Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Upon the Company’s IPO, the Company recognized $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition satisfied at IPO. Shares were then issued related to the vesting of the restricted stock units (""RSUs"") with such performance-based vesting conditions. The Company withheld 24.2 million shares of common stock and based on the IPO price of $68.00 per share to satisfy tax withholding and remittance of approximately $1.6 billion.
Under the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation, which became effective immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company is authorized to issue 4,736,000,000 shares of common stock, including 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 710,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock and 26,000,000 shares of Class H common stock. As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has four classes of authorized common stock: Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class H common stock, of which Class A and Class B had shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In November 2020, 9,200,000 shares of Class H common stock were issued to the Company’s wholly-owned Host Endowment Fund subsidiary and held as treasury stock.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced international, federal, state, and local governments to enforce prohibitions of non-essential activities.
The Company first saw the impact of COVID-19 in China in the last week of January 2020, which when contained to China, had a minor impact on the entire business. The outbreak spread throughout Asia, and then through Europe, North America, and the rest of the world by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Since then, the Company has experienced a significant decline in revenue resulting from a decrease in bookings and an increase in cancellations. The extent and duration of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the Company over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general and on the Company’s business.
As a result, the Company took a number of actions in 2020 in response to the significant decrease in bookings and the adverse impacts on its revenue, operating results, and financial condition as described in Note 11, Debt, Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 19, Restructuring.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require increased judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent the Company’s actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, the Company’s future financial statements could be affected.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIE”) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company determines, at the inception of each arrangement, whether an entity in which it has made an investment or in which it has other variable interest in is considered a VIE. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in its interest or relationship with the entity impact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the investment or other variable interest in a VIE in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company’s consolidated VIEs were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, fair value of investments, useful lives of long-lived assets and intangible assets, valuation of acquired goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions, contingent liabilities, insurance reserves, revenue recognition, valuation of common stock, stock-based compensation, and income and non-income taxes, among others. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company has determined it has one operating and reportable segment as the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents are held in checking and interest-bearing accounts and consist of cash and highly-liquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):
Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days to be marketable securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. As the Company views these securities as available to support current operations, it accounts for these debt securities as available-for-sale and classifies them as short-term assets on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.
Unrealized gains and non-credit related losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and impairments are reported within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The assessment for impairment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, adverse changes in the market or industry of the investee, the Company’s intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis.
The Company’s marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Subsequent to January 1, 2020, the Company accounts for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU No. 2016-13”), which the Company adopted on January 1, 2020. If the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale security exceeds its fair value and if the Company has the intention to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, an impairment is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If the Company does not have the intention to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis and the Company determines that the unrealized loss is entirely or partially due to credit-related factors, the credit loss is measured and recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the Company’s best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.
Non-Marketable Investments
Non-marketable investments consist of debt and equity investments in privately-held companies, which are classified as other assets, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies its non-marketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as available-for-sale. The accounting policy for debt securities classified as available-for-sale is described above. The Company’s non-marketable equity investments are accounted for using either the equity method of accounting or equity investments without readily determinable fair value measurement alternative.
The Company uses the equity method if it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For investments accounted for using the equity method, the Company’s proportionate share of its equity interest in the net income or loss of these companies is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense), net. The carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company’s interest in the investee’s net income or loss and any impairments and is classified in other assets, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets.
Equity investments for which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and for which fair value is not readily determinable are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. This election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for this election. Changes in the basis of the equity investment are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company reviews each of its non-marketable debt and equity investments for impairment at the end of each reporting period or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Impairment indicators might include negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. Upon determining that an impairment exists, the Company recognizes as an impairment in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.
Financial instruments measured and disclosed at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in less active markets or model-derived valuations that are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents, funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, funds payable and amounts payable to customers, and unearned fees approximate their respective fair values because of their short maturities.
Level 2 Valuation Techniques
Financial instruments classified as Level 2 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. Prices of these securities are obtained through independent, third-party pricing services and include market quotations that may include both observable and unobservable inputs. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. The Company’s foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs where applicable, such as interest rate yield curves and currency rates.
Level 3 Valuation Techniques
Financial instruments classified as Level 3 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy consist primarily of a derivative warrant liability relating to the warrants issued in conjunction with the second lien loan discussed in Note 11, Debt. Valuation techniques for the derivative warrant liability include the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with key assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates.
Internal-Use Software
The Company capitalizes certain costs in connection with obtaining or developing software for internal use. Additionally, the Company capitalizes qualifying costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality to existing software. Amortization of such costs begins when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized software development costs are classified as property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the applicable software.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization on property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives indicated below:
Costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of assets are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The Company’s leases often contain rent escalations over the lease term. The Company recognizes expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, tenant incentives, primarily used to fund leasehold improvements, are recognized when earned and reduce the Company’s right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term.
The Company’s lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company has one reporting unit. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. There were no impairment charges in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for additional information.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described below. There were no impairment charges in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for additional information.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets that are held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals.
Any impairments to ROU assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are initially recognized when a decision to do so is made and recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For leased assets, such circumstances would include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $35.8 million of ROU asset impairment charges within restructuring charges in the consolidated statement of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates substantially all of its revenue from facilitating guest stays at accommodations offered by hosts on the Company’s platform.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company considers both hosts and guests to be its customers. The customers agree to the Company’s Terms of Service (“ToS”) to use the Company’s platform. Upon confirmation of a booking made by a guest, the host agrees to provide the use of the property. At such time, the host and guest also agree upon the applicable booking value as well as host fees and guest fees (collectively “service fees”). The Company charges service fees in exchange for certain activities, including the use of the Company’s platform, customer support, and payment processing activities. These activities are not distinct from each other and are not separate performance obligations. As a result, the Company’s single performance obligation is to facilitate a stay, which occurs upon the completion of a check-in event (a “check-in”). The Company recognizes revenue upon check-in as its performance obligation is satisfied upon check-in and the Company has the right to receive payment for the fulfillment of the performance obligation.
The Company charges service fees to its customers as a percentage of the value of the booking, excluding taxes. The Company collects both the booking value from the guest on behalf of the host and the applicable guest fees owed to the Company using the guest’s pre-authorized payment method. After check-in, the Company disburses the booking value to the host, less the fees due from the host to the Company. The Company’s ToS stipulates that a host may cancel a confirmed booking at any time up to check-in. Therefore, the Company determined that for accounting purposes, each booking is a separate contract with the host and guest, and the contracts are not enforceable until check-in. Since an enforceable contract for accounting purposes is not established until check-in, there were no partially satisfied or unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. The service fees collected from customers prior to check-in are recorded as unearned fees. Unearned fees are not considered contract balances under ASC 606-10-50-8 because they are subject to refund in the event of a cancellation.
Guest stays of at least 28 nights are considered long-term stays. The Company charges service fees to facilitate long-term stays on a monthly basis. Such stays are generally cancelable with a 30 days advance notice for no significant penalty. Accordingly, long-term stays are treated as month-to-month contracts; each month is a separate contract with the host and guest, and the contracts are not enforceable until check-in for the initial month as well as subsequent monthly extensions. The Company’s performance obligation for long-term stays is the same as that for short-term stays. The Company recognizes revenue for the first month upon check-in, similar to short-term stays, and recognizes revenue for any subsequent months upon each month’s anniversary from initial check-in date.
The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether or not it is the principal (gross) or the agent (net) in the transaction. As part of the evaluation, the Company considers whether it controls the right to use the property before control is transferred. Indicators of control that the Company considers include whether the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise associated with the rental of the property, whether it has inventory risk associated with the property, and whether it has discretion in establishing the prices for the property. The Company determined that it does not control the right to use the properties either before or after completion of its service. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that it is acting in an agent capacity and revenue is presented net reflecting the service fees received from guests and hosts to facilitate a stay.
The Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, including the costs of certain referrer fees, as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The Company has no significant financing components in its contracts with customers.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company has elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.
Payments to Customers
The Company makes payments to customers as part of its referral programs and marketing promotions, collectively referred to as the Company’s incentive programs, and refund activities. The payments are generally in the form of coupon credits to be applied toward future bookings or as cash refunds.
Incentive Programs
The Company encourages the use of its platform and attracts new customers through its incentive programs.
Under the Company’s referral program, the referring party (the “referrer”) earns a coupon when the new guest or host (the “referee”) completes their first stay on the Company’s platform. Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense in the same way the Company accounts for other marketing services from third-party vendors. Any amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the referral service received are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. Customer referral coupon credits generally expire within one year from issuance and the Company estimates the redemption rates using its historical experience. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the referral coupon liability was not material.
Through marketing promotions, the Company issues customer coupon credits to encourage the use of its platform. After a customer redeems such incentives, the Company records a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction, as the Company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the customer incentive payment.
Refunds
In certain instances, the Company issues refunds to customers as part of its customer support activities in the form of cash or credits to be applied toward a future booking. There is no legal obligation to issue such refunds to hosts or guests on behalf of its customers. The Company accounts for refunds, net of any recoveries, as variable consideration, which results in a reduction to revenue. The Company reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the payments by applying the most likely outcome method based on known facts and circumstances and historical experience. The estimate for variable consideration was not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
The Company evaluates whether the cumulative amount of payments made to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service received from customers exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the customer relationships. Any cumulative payments in excess of cumulative revenue are presented within operations and support or sales and marketing on the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the payments made to customers.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, payments made to customers resulted in: reductions to revenue of $221.5 million, $274.5 million, and $384.2 million, respectively; charges to operations and support of $68.9 million, $103.4 million, and $83.1 million, respectively; and, charges to sales and marketing expense of $120.2 million, $129.6 million, and $56.7 million, respectively.
Funds Receivable and Funds Payable
Funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers represent cash received or in-transit from guests via third-party credit card processors and other payment methods, which flows through a Company bank account for payment to hosts following check-in. This cash and related receivable represent the total amount due to hosts, and as such, a liability for the same amount is recorded to funds payable and amounts payable to customers.
The Company records guest payments, net of service fees, as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding amount in funds payable and amounts payable to customers when cash is received in advance of check-in. Host and guest fees are recorded as cash with a corresponding amount in unearned fees. For certain bookings, a guest may opt to pay a percentage of the total amount due when the booking is confirmed, with the remaining balance due prior to the stay occurring (the “Pay Less Upfront Program”). Under the Pay Less Upfront Program, when the Company receives the first installment payment from the guest upon confirmation of the booking, the Company records the first installment payment as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding amount in funds payable and amounts payable to customers, net of the host and guest fees. The full value of the service fees is recorded as cash and cash equivalents and unearned fees upon receipt of the first installment payment to represent what the Company expects to be recognized as revenue if the underlying booking is not canceled. Upon receipt of the second installment, such payment amounts are also recorded as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding amount in funds payable and amounts payable to customers.
Following check-in, the Company remits funds due to hosts and recognizes unearned fees as revenue as its performance obligation is satisfied.
Bad Debt
The Company generally collects funds related to bookings from guests on behalf of hosts prior to check-in. However, in limited circumstances the Company disburses funds to a host or a guest on behalf of a counterparty guest or host prior to collecting such amounts from the counterparty. Such uncollected balances generally arise from the timing of payments and collections related to a dispute resolution between the guest and host or certain alterations to stays and are included in prepaids and other current assets on the
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
consolidated balance sheets. The Company records a customer receivable allowance for credit losses for funds that may never be collected. The Company estimated its exposure to balances deemed to be uncollectible based on factors including known facts and circumstances, historical experience, and the age of the uncollected balances. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the Company estimates its expected credit losses for the customer receivable allowance based on factors including known facts and circumstances, historical experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions, and the age of the uncollected balances. The Company writes off the asset when it is determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense was $49.0 million, $77.1 million, and $107.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of payment processing charges, including merchant fees and chargebacks, costs associated with third-party data centers used to host the Company’s platform, and amortization of internally developed software and acquired technology.
Operations and Support
Operations and support costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees associated with customer support provided via phone, email, and chat to hosts and guests, customer relations costs, which include refunds and credits related to customer satisfaction and expenses associated with the Company’s host protection programs, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Product Development
Product development costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees incurred in connection with the development of the Company’s platform and new products as well as the improvement of existing products, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of performance and brand marketing, personnel-related expenses, including those related to field operations, portions of referral incentives and coupons, policy and communications, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology. These costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $474.5 million, $712.6 million, and $176.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
General and Administrative
General and administrative costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for executive management and administrative functions, including finance and accounting, legal, and human resources, as well as general corporate and director and officer insurance. General and administrative costs also include certain professional services fees, allocated costs for facilities and information technology expenses, indirect taxes including lodging taxes where the Company may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and bad debt expense. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Restructuring Charges
Costs and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are incurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoing employee termination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is reasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates based on currently available information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition, step one, occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement, step two, determines the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained.
Foreign Currency
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company determines the functional currency for each of its foreign subsidiaries by reviewing their operations and currencies used in their primary economic environments. Assets and liabilities for foreign subsidiaries with
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
functional currency other than U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the balance sheet date. Statements of operations amounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity (deficit). No material amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Remeasurement gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and nonmonetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical exchange rates. Total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions and balances totaled $(6.0) million, $(4.8) million, and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
Derivative Instruments
The Company enters into financial derivative instruments, consisting of foreign currency contracts to mitigate its exposure to the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on its transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the changes occur.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant. Calculating the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model requires certain highly subjective inputs and assumptions. The Company estimates the expected term of stock options granted based on the simplified method and estimates the volatility of its common stock on the date of grant based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the weighted-average time to vesting and the contractual maturity. The simplified method is used as the Company does not have sufficient historical data regarding stock option exercises. In addition, the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for its stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. The contractual term of the Company’s stock options is ten years.
Prior to the Company’s IPO, the absence of an active market for the Company’s common stock required the Company’s board of directors, which includes members who possess extensive business, finance, and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of its common stock for purposes of granting stock options and RSUs. The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the board of directors in determining the fair value of the Company’s common stock. All stock options granted are exercisable at a price per share not less than the fair value of the shares of the Company’s common stock as determined by the board of directors (the “Fair Value”) underlying those stock options on their respective grant dates.
The fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value on the date of grant. The contractual term of the RSUs is seven years. Substantially all of the Company’s RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition. In November 2019, the Company also began granting RSUs with a service-based vesting condition only. Stock-based compensation expense is only recognized for RSUs for which the service-based and liquidity-event performance-based vesting conditions have been met. The liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition for RSUs was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO Registration Statement on December 9, 2020. Upon the Company’s IPO in December 2020, the Company recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs, which vest upon satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The Company recognizes stock-based expense related to shares issued pursuant to its ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months. The ESPP provides for overlapping offering periods of twelve months, each comprised of six month purchase periods. The first offering period commenced on December 9, 2020 and will end on November 15, 2021, with the first purchase period thereunder ending on May 15, 2021 and the second purchase period thereunder ending on November 15, 2021. Offering periods thereafter will commence on each May 16 and November 16. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. The Company estimates the fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company applies the two-class method when computing net loss per share attributable to common stockholders when shares are issued that meet the definition of a participating security. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires earnings available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all earnings for the period had been distributed.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Company’s previously outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock was a participating security as the holders of such shares participated in dividends but did not contractually participate in the Company’s losses.
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less weighted-average shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) reflects gains and losses that are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and are excluded from net income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments related to consolidation of foreign entities and unrealized gains (losses) on securities classified as available-for-sale.
Contingencies
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which has subsequently been amended by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20, 2019-01, and 2019-10. The guidance requires the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for substantially all leases under U.S. GAAP. The guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The expense recognition and cash flow treatment arising from a finance lease and operating lease by a lessee have not changed significantly from previous U.S. GAAP. For operating leases, a lessee is required to do the following: (i) recognize a ROU asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, on the consolidated balance sheets; (ii) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, generally on a straight-line basis; and (iii) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019.
The adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements, with the most significant effects related to: (i) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for its real estate and data center operating leases; (ii) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions (arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements); (iii) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain assets constructed under build-to-suit lease arrangements that the Company subsequently leased; (iv) no longer reporting in the consolidated statements of operations a portion of lease expense for build-to-suit leases in interest expense, but rather, as a component of costs and expenses; and (v) providing significant new disclosures about the Company’s leasing activities.
Upon adoption, the Company recognized an operating lease ROU asset of $340.2 million and lease liabilities of $366.0 million, which included the derecognition of $62.0 million of build-to-suit assets and $84.0 million of corresponding financing obligations subsequently assessed as operating leases. The new standard also provided practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting as well as transition. The Company has elected the: (i) short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, whereby the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition; (ii) practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of the Company’s leases; (iii) optional transition method that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and will not restate prior periods, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $22.2 million; and (iv) transition package of three expedients, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, which amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities from an incurred loss methodology to an expected loss methodology. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and instead requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses, rather than a write-down, limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. Additional disclosures about significant estimates and credit quality are also required. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU has subsequently been amended by ASUs 2018-19, 2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, and 2019-11. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323 and Topic 815, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The standard is effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022 and may be applied at the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020 or any date thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, which clarifies when an entity should assess whether a callable debt security is within the scope of accounting guidance, which impacts the amortization period for nonrefundable fees and other costs. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, the amendments are to be applied on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
There are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, and the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Term Loans
In April 2020, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “First Lien Credit Agreement,” and the loans thereunder, the “First Lien Loan”), resulting in proceeds of $961.4 million, net of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $38.6 million. The loan is due and payable in April 2025. The underlying loan can be repaid in whole or in part prior to April 2025 at the Company’s option, subject to applicable prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums. Beginning in September 2020, the Company is required to repay the First Lien Loan in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Loan, with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date. Additionally, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay in cash all or a portion of outstanding First Lien Loan, plus any applicable prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums, in the event of non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, or incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. The Company can select a per annum interest rate equal to (i) 7.5% plus the London Interbank Offered Rate (customarily defined, with LIBOR replacement provisions consistent with the April 2019 Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended fallback language for syndicated loans, “LIBOR”), subject to a floor of 1.0%, or (ii) 6.5% plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1%, in each case subject to a floor of 2%. Interest is payable monthly or quarterly in arrears at the Company’s option depending on the selected per annum interest rate and interest period.
Also in April 2020, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion Second Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement,” and the loans thereunder, the “Second Lien Loan”), resulting in net proceeds of $967.5 million, net of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $32.5 million. The loan is due and payable in July 2025. The underlying loan can be repaid in whole or in part prior to July 2025, subject to applicable prepayment premiums, make-whole premiums, and the priority of lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement over any proceeds the Company receives from the sale of collateral. Additionally, subject to the Company’s obligation to make mandatory prepayments under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay in cash all or a portion of outstanding Second Lien Loans, plus any applicable prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums, in the event of non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, or incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. The Company can select the per annum interest rate equal to (i) 10% plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, or (ii) 9% plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1%, in each case subject to a floor of 3%. Interest is payable monthly or quarterly in arrears, at the Company’s option depending on the selected per annum interest rate and interest period. In addition, at the Company’s election, payment-in-kind interest up to 5.5% per annum may be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Second Lien Loan by such amount.
The debt discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense of $157.1 million was recorded for the First Lien and Second Lien Loans relating to the contractual interest and amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.
As of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the First Lien Loan and Second Lien Loan were $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or Level 2 inputs.
The First Lien Loan and the Second Lien Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and are both secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and of these subsidiary guarantors.
The First Lien Loan and Second Lien Loan contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including restrictions on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes including mergers and consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or other distributions, make acquisitions, investments, loans or advances, or payments and prepayments of junior or unsecured indebtedness. The First Lien Loan and Second Lien Loan also contain customary events of default, including a change in control.

In connection with the Second Lien Loan, the Company issued warrants to purchase 7,934,794 shares of Class A common stock with an initial exercise price of $28.355 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, to the Second Lien Loan lenders. The warrants expire on April 17, 2030 and the exercise price can be settled in cash or in net shares at the holder’s option. The fair value of the warrants at issuance was $116.6 million and was recorded as a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding debt discount recorded against the Second Lien Loan. The warrant liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date as long as the warrants remain outstanding and unexercised with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the warrant totaled $985.2 million, or an increase in liability of $868.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
2016 Credit Facility
In April 2016, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “2016 Credit Facility”) with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A.

The 2016 Credit Facility also provides a $100.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Facility includes a commitment fee of 0.125% per annum on any undrawn amounts.
Outstanding borrowings bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%; (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day by Bank of America as its “prime rate”; or (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate for one month plus 1.00%. Borrowing terms vary based on the type of borrowing with all outstanding balances being due on April 26, 2021, the termination date of the 2016 Credit Facility. Outstanding balances may be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. The 2016 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes, and pay dividends or other distributions, as well as certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2016 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled $53.0 million. On April 17, 2020, the Company terminated the 2016 Credit Facility. Certain letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Facility were transferred to new issuers upon the termination of the 2016 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit formerly under the 2016 Credit Facility totaled $32.9 million and were secured by cash collateral of $33.8 million, which was recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.
2020 Credit Facility
On November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a five-year secured revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement, which provides for an initial borrowing commitment by a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. of $500.0 million (“2020 Credit Facility”). The 2020 Credit Facility provides a $200.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2020 Credit Facility has a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on any undrawn amounts, payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on borrowings is equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 1.5% plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0%, or (ii) in the case of base rate borrowings, 0.5% plus the greatest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as its “prime rate”, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.0%, in each case subject to a floor of 1.0%. Outstanding balances may be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. The 2020 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes, and pay dividends or other distributions, as well as certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2020. No amounts have been drawn on the 2020 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and outstanding letters of credit totaled $21.4 million.
Note 12. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Upon closing of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 240.9 million shares of Class B common stock, including 1,286,694 shares of Class B common stock issuable pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions relating to the Company’s Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The following table presents the Company’s authorized and outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
The following summarizes the rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock preceding the Company’s IPO:
Dividends
Holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock were entitled to receive annual, noncumulative dividends of at least 8% of the original issue price per share, if, when and as declared by the Company’s board of directors prior to payment of any dividends to common stockholders (other than dividends on shares of common stock payable in common stock). After such dividends, any additional dividends were payable on a pro rata basis to the holders of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (assuming the conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock at the then current applicable conversion price).
Liquidation Preference
Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or Deemed Liquidation Event as defined in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was in effect prior to the IPO (collectively, a “Liquidation Event”), holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock were entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders before any payment to the holders of common stock, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the applicable original issue price per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends or (ii) an amount per share as would have been payable had all the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock been converted into common stock, at the then-applicable conversion rate, immediately prior to the Liquidation Event (“Liquidation Amount”). In the event the Company had insufficient assets to pay the holders of shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock the full liquidation preference, the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock would be paid ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled. Any assets of the Company remaining after payment of the above liquidation preference to the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock would be distributed solely to holders of common stock, pro rata, based on the number of shares held by each holder. The Company classified its redeemable convertible preferred stock as mezzanine equity, or outside of stockholders’ equity (deficit), because the shares contained liquidation features that were not solely within the Company’s control.
Conversion Rights
Each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock was initially convertible at the option of the holder into one share of Class B common stock.
All shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of Class B common stock, at the then-applicable conversion rate, upon the closing of a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement resulting in at least $75.0 million of gross proceeds to the Company, or the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock as a single class on an as-converted basis; provided that such vote or consent may have required the approval of certain majority of holders of certain series of redeemable convertible preferred stock.
The Series C redeemable convertible preferred stockholders were entitled to an anti-dilution feature, whereby the conversion price of the Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock was adjusted based on an adjustment formula in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was in effect prior to the IPO. As of December 31, 2019, 1,286,694 of additional shares of Class B common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock based on the adjustments to the conversion price. Immediately prior to the completion of the Company’s IPO in December 2020, these shares were converted into the Company’s Class B common stock.
Voting Rights
Except as provided in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was in effect prior to the IPO, holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock would vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Redemption Rights
The holders of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not have redemption rights; however, as noted above, the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was in effect prior to the IPO provides that upon a Liquidation Event such shares will be entitled to receive the applicable Liquidation Amount.
Common Stock
The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 710,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. Both classes of common stock have a par value of $0.0001 per share. Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to 20 votes per share. A share of Class B common stock is convertible into a share of Class A common stock voluntarily at any time by the holder, and will convert automatically into a share of Class A common stock upon the earlier of (a) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a separate series, and (b) the 20-year anniversary of the closing of the IPO. In addition, with certain exceptions as further described in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, transfers of Class B common stock will result in the conversion of such share of Class B common stock into a share of Class A common stock.
Under the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company was also authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock and 26,000,000 shares of Class H common stock. Each share of Class C common stock is entitled to no votes and will not be convertible into any other shares of the Company’s capital stock. Each share of Class H common stock is entitled to no votes and will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not the Company’s subsidiary.
The Company had shares of common stock reserved for issuance as follows (in thousands):
(1) Includes warrants issued in connection with the Second Lien Loan as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Class A Common Stock Warrants and Class B Common Stock Warrants below for further discussion.
Class A Common Stock Warrants
As described above in Note 11, Debt, in connection with the Second Lien Loan entered into in April 2020, the Company issued warrants to purchase 7,934,794 shares of Class A common stock with an initial exercise price of $28.355 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, to the Second Lien Loan lenders.
Class B Common Stock Warrants
In connection with the closing of the Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in 2015, the Company issued warrants exercisable for up to 429,672 shares of Class B common stock. The amount exercisable was based on specific financial milestones achieved during 2018 and 2019. Due to the nature of the terms of the warrants, the warrants qualified as a liability-classified derivative. The warrants were valued as of the issuance date using a Monte Carlo simulation model with varying assumptions including booking projections and probability of achievement. The warrants were marked to market at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in sales and

marketing expense, given that the warrants are dependent on selling related activities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were not material. Based on the milestones achieved, as of December 31, 2019, the warrants were exercisable for 237,756 shares of Class B common stock and on December 31, 2019, the fair value of the derivative warrant liability of $14.1 million was reclassified from liability to equity as it met the requirements for permanent equity classification. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the warrants were exercised by the respective holders.
In addition, in connection with the execution of a prior loan agreement, the Company issued a warrant for 150,000 shares of Class B common stock, exercisable any time through June 2019. In June 2019, the warrant was net exercised for a total of 144,986 shares of Class B common stock.
Equity Incentive Plans
2008 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2008, the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”). The 2008 Plan provided for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”), restricted stock awards and RSUs. ISOs and NQSOs granted under the 2008 Plan are at a price per share not less than the fair value at date of grant.
2018 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) to replace the 2008 Plan. A total of 50.0 million shares of Class B common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan and the 13.2 million shares remaining for issuance under the 2008 Plan were added to the number of shares available under the 2018 Plan. The expiration of the 2008 Plan had no impact on the terms of outstanding awards under that plan. All unvested equity canceled under the 2008 Plan were added to the 2018 Plan and made available for future issuance.
Assumed Equity Incentive Plan
In connection with the acquisition of HotelTonight, the Company assumed stock options and RSUs under HotelTonight’s equity incentive plan (the “Assumed Equity Incentive Plan”). As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a total of 246,998 and 150,816 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, respectively, were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under this assumed plan. The weighted-average exercise price of these outstanding stock options was $22.69 per share and $22.61 per share as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a total of 55,148 and 12,550 RSUs, respectively, were issued and outstanding under this assumed plan. No additional stock options or RSUs may be granted under the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan.
2020 Incentive Award Plan
In 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020 Plan,” and together with the 2008 Plan, 2018 Plan, and the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan, the “Plans”). Under the 2020 Plan, 62,069,613 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2020 Plan will be increased by (i) the number of shares subject to awards outstanding under the 2008 Plan, Assumed Equity Incentive Plan, and 2018 Plan as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan that subsequently terminate, are exchanged for cash, surrendered or repurchased, or are tendered or withheld to satisfy any exercise price or tax withholding obligations and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in 2030, equal to the lesser of (A) 5% of the shares of all series of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding year and (B) such smaller number of shares of stock as determined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that no more than 371,212,920 shares of stock may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options.

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Unit Activity
The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the range of assumptions in the following table:
A summary of option and RSU activity under the Plans was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
(1) The outstanding options and RSUs include 290,236 options and 56,552 RSUs in 2019 that were granted from the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan. There were no options or RSUs that were granted from the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan for the year ended December 31, 2020.
(2) The total RSUs that vested during 2019 were not material.
(3) The outstanding options and RSUs include cancellations of 36,342 and 55,158 options and 1,404 and 14,178 RSUs in 2019 and 2020, respectively, from the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan that are no longer available for future grants.
(4) Includes 62,069,613 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2020 Incentive Award Plan.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the weighted-average fair value of stock options granted under the Plans was $24.23, $33.46, and $15.42 per share, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $48.8 million, $50.4 million, and $476.0 million, respectively, and the total grant-date fair value of stock options that vested was $24.6 million, $44.6 million, and $44.4 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, there was $107.1 million, and $45.4 million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards granted under the Plans. The unrecognized cost as of December 31, 2020 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

Nonemployee Stock Options
For stock options granted to nonemployees, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value on the date of grant. Total nonemployee stock compensation recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was not material.
Common Shares Issued for Conversion of Convertible Note
In connection with its Luxury Retreats acquisition, the Company entered into an unsecured convertible promissory note with a stockholder of Luxury Retreats. The note converted into 1,236,788 unvested shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on May 15, 2017. The fair value of the shares issued upon conversion of the note was $64. 9 million and was recognized as compensation expense within product development expenses over the four-year vesting period. The Company recognized compensation expense, in product development within the consolidated statements of operations, of $19.6 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units
Substantially all of the Company’s RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based and a liquidity-event performance-based requirement. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is generally satisfied over four years. The liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied upon (i) an initial public offering or (ii) change in control of the Company as defined in the Company’s equity incentive plans. The RSUs vested on the first date upon which both the service-based and liquidity-event performance-based requirements were satisfied. If the RSUs vested, the Company would deliver one share of common stock for each vested RSU on the settlement date. The liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition was deemed satisfied upon the IPO.
Restricted Common Stock
The Company has granted restricted common stock to certain continuing employees, primarily in connection with acquisitions. Vesting of this stock is primarily dependent on a service-based vesting condition that generally becomes satisfied over a period of four years. The Company has the right to repurchase or cancel shares for which the vesting condition is not satisfied.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s restricted common stock (in thousands, except for per share amounts):
Stock-Based Compensation
The following table summarizes total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands):
Through December 9, 2020, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized for certain awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition based on the occurrence of a qualifying event, as such qualifying event was not probable. Upon the Company's IPO, the liquidity-event performance-based condition was met and $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense was recognized related to these awards.
The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $3.6 million, $9.8 million, and $39.9 million in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In December 2020, the Company’s board of directors adopted the ESPP. The maximum number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for sale under the ESPP is equal to the sum of (i) 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in 2030, equal to the lesser of (a) 1% of shares of Class A common stock (on an as converted basis) on the last day immediately preceding year and (b) such number of shares of common stock as determined by the board of directors; provided, however, that no more than 89,785,394 shares may be issued under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, there were no shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The Company has commitments including purchase obligations for web-hosting services and other commitments for brand marketing. The following table presents these non-cancelable commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
Extenuating Circumstances Policy
In March 2020, the Company applied its extenuating circumstances policy to cancellations resulting from COVID-19. That policy provides hosts and guests with greater flexibility to cancel reservations that are disrupted by epidemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies. Specifically, accommodation bookings made by guests on or before March 14, 2020, have so far been covered by the policy and may be canceled before check-in. To support hosts impacted by elevated guest cancellations under that policy, the Company committed up to $250 million for hosts. The reservations eligible for this $250 million host program were defined as reservations made on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and May 31, 2020. For these reservations, eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the host’s cancellation policies. These payments are accounted for as consideration paid to a customer and as such, result in a reduction to revenue. Under this policy, the Company recorded $205.1 million of payments, primarily for hosts, in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Lodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters
Some states and localities in the United States and elsewhere in the world impose transient occupancy or lodging accommodations taxes (“Lodging Taxes”) on the use or occupancy of lodging accommodations or other traveler services. The Company collects and remits Lodging Taxes in more than 29,800 jurisdictions on behalf of its hosts. Such Lodging Taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a 30 to 90-day period following the end of each month.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had an obligation to remit Lodging Taxes collected from guests who had stayed in these jurisdictions totaling $103.7 million and $84.0 million, respectively. These payables were recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
In jurisdictions where the Company does not collect and remit Lodging Taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes primarily rests with hosts. The Company has estimated liabilities in a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where management believes it is probable that the Company can be held jointly liable with hosts for taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, accrued obligations related to these estimated taxes, including estimated penalties and interest, totaled $138.4 million and $52.9 million, respectively. With respect to lodging and related taxes for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued.
The Company’s potential obligations with respect to Lodging Taxes could be affected by various factors, which include, but are not limited to, whether the Company determines, or any tax authority asserts, that the Company has a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historical or future transactions or by the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject the Company’s operations to such taxes. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of Lodging Taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts that the Company has recorded.
The Company is currently involved in lawsuits brought by certain states and localities involving the payment of Lodging Taxes. These jurisdictions are asserting that the Company is liable or jointly liable with hosts to collect and remit Lodging Taxes. These lawsuits are in various stages and the Company continues to vigorously defend these claims. The Company believes that the statutes at issue impose a Lodging Tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, or the Company’s hosts. In March 2020, a fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed that the Company is not a dealer under the Florida and County Tourist Development Tax Law, and therefore not liable for collecting Lodging Taxes. Accordingly, the Company concluded in the first quarter of 2020 that the liabilities accrued in all Florida counties were no longer probable and reduced its reserves for Lodging Taxes by $87.0 million, including interest. A motion was
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
filed with the Florida Supreme Court in July 2020, and was subsequently denied in October 2020. The ultimate resolution of all remaining unresolved lawsuits cannot be determined at this time.
The imposition of such taxes on the Company could increase the cost of a guest booking and potentially cause a reduction in the volume of bookings on the Company’s platform, which would adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor the application and interpretation of lodging and related taxes and ordinances and will adjust accruals based on any new information or further developments.
The Company is under audit and inquiry by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities primarily arises from the Company’s transactions with its hosts and guests, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with hosts and guests, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value-added, and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such hosts. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcomes may exceed the estimated liabilities recorded.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company recorded $49.6 million of tax expense, $4.0 million of tax benefit, and $16.3 million of tax expense related to estimated hosts’ withholding tax obligations, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company accrued a total of $118.1 million and $134.4 million of estimated tax liabilities, including interest, related to hosts’ withholding tax obligations, respectively. The Company has identified reasonably possible exposures related to withholding income taxes and value added taxes, and has not accrued for these amounts since the likelihood of the contingent liability is less than probable. At this time, the Company believes any losses that may arise from these potential liabilities would be immaterial; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. With respect to all other withholding tax on payments made to hosts and transactional taxes for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued.
In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company accrued a total of $55.4 million and $65.9 million of estimated tax liabilities related to certain employee benefits and related employment taxes, respectively. Refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion on other tax matters.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
The Company has been and is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business. Such proceedings and claims, even if not meritorious, can require significant financial and operational resources, including the diversion of management’s attention from the Company’s business objectives.
Regulatory Matters
The Company operates in a complex legal and regulatory environment and its operations are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to: Internet activities; short-term rentals, long-term rentals and home sharing; real estate, property rights, housing and land use; travel and hospitality; privacy and data protection; intellectual property; competition; health and safety; protection of minors; consumer protection; employment; payments, money transmission, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery; taxation; and others. In addition, the nature of the Company’s business exposes it to inquiries and potential claims related to the compliance of the business with applicable law and regulations. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being applied, interpreted or implemented to address aspects of the Company’s business, and such adoption or interpretation could further alter or impact the Company’s business.
In certain instances, the Company has been party to litigation with municipalities relating to or arising out of certain regulations. In addition, the implementation and enforcement of regulation can have an impact on the Company’s business.
New York, New York. In 2010, New York amended its state law to ban the short-term rental of multiple dwelling units in New York City unless a permanent resident is present during the stay. In October 2016, the state amended the law to also ban the advertising of such short-term rentals, and the Company filed a lawsuit against both the state and the city of New York challenging the applicability of the 2016 amendment to the Company. In November and December 2016, the Company settled the lawsuit against the state and the city, respectively, with each agreeing not to enforce the amended law against the Company. Separately, New York City interprets its Administrative Code to bar or regulate short-term rentals in New York City unless specific requirements are met. In July 2018, New York City enacted a new law requiring home sharing platforms to disclose detailed data on hosts and listings to the city on a monthly basis. In August 2018, the Company filed a lawsuit against the city challenging the new data disclosure law on constitutional and statutory grounds. In January 2019, a federal judge entered a preliminary injunction barring the law from going into effect. On February 13, 2020, the parties requested that the Court stay the action so that the parties could explore settlement. In June 2020, the Company settled its lawsuit with New York City. Under the terms of the settlement, the city ordinance was amended to reduce the number of listings subject to data sharing and to provide for the confidentiality of data. The revised ordinance went into effect in January 2021.
Japan. In June 2018, a new national law, the Japanese Private Lodging Act (Act No. 65 of 2017), went into effect to legalize the short-term rental of primary and secondary residences in Japan for up to 180 nights per fiscal year. Under the law, hosts are required to register their rental with the local government. The Company is also required to register as an intermediary (bai-kai) with the Japanese Tourism Agency, and the law prohibits any registered intermediary from intermediating an illegal listing, including unregistered listings. The Company is required to remove listings that do not post a valid registration/license number. At the time of the law’s implementation, the Company took
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
down a significant number of listings and canceled associated reservations. The Company is continuing to take steps to fully comply with the law.
Paris, France. In December 2017, Paris further tightened the rules around short-term rental regulations. Hosts of entire primary and secondary homes offered for short-term rentals are required to obtain and display a registration number from the city in any advertising of the rental in order to demonstrate compliance. Following an unsuccessful proceeding in early 2018 seeking to compel the Company to enforce compliance in respect of 67 unregistered listings, the City of Paris launched a second proceeding against the Company in February 2019. The grounds were similar relating to 1,010 allegedly unregistered listings with a potential fine of 12.6 million Euros. A decision on the merits of this case is not expected before the third quarter of 2021. The Company announced in February 2021 that it is implementing registration requirements in certain large French cities, starting with Paris in the second quarter of 2021, which may resolve this pending proceeding.
In addition to the above matters, the Company has been and is currently party or subject to various other government inquiries, investigations and proceedings related to legal and regulatory requirements. For example, the Company is required to comply with governmental economic and trade sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and other similar international agencies. In many cases, these inquiries, investigations and proceedings can be complex, time consuming, costly to investigate, and can require significant company and management attention. For certain matters, the Company has investigated and is implementing recommended changes to its managerial, operational and compliance practices. The Company is unable to predict the outcomes and implications on the Company’s business, industry practices or online commerce more generally. Furthermore, the outcome of these proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.
Intellectual Property
The Company has been and is currently subject to claims relating to intellectual property, including alleged patent infringement. Adverse results in such lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing the Company from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause the Company to change its business practices or require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise harm its business. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such cases and has not recorded any material liabilities in its consolidated financial statements related to such matters.
Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings
The Company has been and is currently subject involved in litigation and legal proceedings and subject to legal claims in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the above, these include legal claims asserting, among other things, commercial, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer, personal injury, and property rights.
Depending on the nature of the claim, the Company may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, and/or injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes, the Company believes based on its current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable losses. Such currently accrued amounts are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, management’s views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and the matters continue to develop. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to losses in excess of the amounts accrued. With respect to outstanding legal matters, based on current knowledge, the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.
Host Protections
The Company offers a Host Guarantee Program that provides protection of up to $1.0 million for direct physical loss or damage to a host’s covered property caused by guests during a confirmed booking and when the host and guest are unable to resolve the dispute. The Company retains risk and also maintains insurance from third parties on a per claim basis to protect the Company’s financial exposure under this program. In addition, through third-party insurers and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary created during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company provides insurance coverage for third-party bodily injury or property damage liability claims that occur during a stay. This host protection insurance offering consists of a commercial general liability policy, with hosts and the Company as named insureds and landlords of hosts as additional insureds. The host protection insurance program provides primary coverage for up to $1.0 million per occurrence, subject to a $1.0 million cap per listing location, and includes various market standard conditions, limitations, and exclusions.
Indemnifications
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors. The indemnification agreements and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) require the Company to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent not prohibited by Delaware law. Subject to certain limitations, the indemnification agreements and Bylaws also require the Company to advance
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
expenses incurred by its directors and officers. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under the indemnification agreements or the Bylaws, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has included limited indemnification provisions under certain agreements with parties with whom the Company has commercial relations of varying scope and terms with respect to certain matters, including losses arising out of its breach of such agreements or out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with the Company’s indemnification provisions.

The following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate:
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, the difference in the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, the Company’s full valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets, and the Company’s uncertain tax positions.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the difference in the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate was primarily due to the Company’s full valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and the Company’s tax impact of restructuring and the IPO.
The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):
In December 2019, the Company transferred certain intangible assets among its wholly-owned subsidiaries to align its structure to its evolving operations. The transfer resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets of $789.6 million. Based on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreign deferred tax assets would be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, these deferred tax assets were offset by a full valuation allowance.
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company completed a restructuring plan to repatriate its intellectual property to the United States to align with its evolving operations in a post-COVID-19 environment. The Company eliminated the $789.6 million foreign deferred tax asset and valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, and recorded a U.S. deferred tax asset of $140.7 million from a step-up in the tax basis of certain repatriated intellectual property. Based on available objective evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that these additional U.S. deferred tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2020 and, therefore, these deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance.
In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company weighs both positive and negative evidence in the various jurisdictions in which it operates to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets are recoverable. In assessing the ultimate realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available evidence, including cumulative historic and forecasted losses, and as such, does not believe it is more likely than not that its U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established in the United States, and no deferred tax assets and related tax benefit have been recognized in the financial statements. As a result of the restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company released the valuation allowance that was previously recorded in Ireland due to expected future income. There is no valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions that have cumulative income and expected future income.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the net increase in the Company’s valuation allowance compared to the prior year was primarily due to the step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights created upon an intra-entity transfer, and an increase in tax credits generated, accruals, reserves, and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net increase in the Company’s valuation allowance compared to the prior year was primarily due to the 2020 net operating loss, an increase in tax credits generated, accruals and reserves, and stock-based compensation.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted by the United States on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act contains certain tax provisions, including provisions that retroactively and/or temporarily suspend or relax in certain respects the application of certain provisions in the Act, such as the limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and interest. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a benefit of $95.6 million related to the carryback of its 2020 net operating loss.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $116.7 million and $5.1 billion, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2034. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $84.1 million and $287.0 million, respectively. The research and development tax credits will expire beginning in 2034 if not utilized.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $167.6 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2033. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had state research and development carryforwards and enterprise zone tax credit carryforwards of $78.5 million and $200.8 million, respectively. The research and development tax credits do not expire, and the enterprise zone tax credits will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2023.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and similar California legislation impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the event that there is a change in ownership as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such a limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before utilization, which could result in increased future tax liabilities.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows (in thousands):
The Company is in various stages of examination in connection with its ongoing tax audits globally, and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been recorded for any adjustments that may result from tax audits. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company may be required to record an adjustment to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact the Company’s tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company may experience an increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of additional assessments by various tax authorities, possibly reach resolution of income tax
Airbnb, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
examinations in one or more jurisdictions, or lapses of the statute of limitations. However, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in the next twelve months cannot be made.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, $266.4 million and $184.7 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits represents the amount that would, if recognized, impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.
In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, it recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. The Company’s accrual for interest and penalties was $41.4 million and $52.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The Company’s significant tax jurisdictions include the United States, California, and Ireland. The Company is currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. The primary issue under examination in the 2013 audit is the valuation of the Company’s international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2019, new information became available which required the Company to remeasure its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded additional tax expense of $196.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS which proposes an increase to the Company’s U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash liability of $1.35 billion, subject to penalties and interest. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any exceeding the Company’s current reserves, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company intends to vigorously contest the IRS’s proposed adjustment, including through all administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies which includes entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“IRS Appeals”) in 2021, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court’s decision to the appropriate appellate court. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.
On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court (the “Tax Court”) issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner (the “Tax Court Opinion”), which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to stock-based compensation. The Tax Court Opinion was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the “Ninth Circuit”). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (the “Ninth Circuit Opinion”) that reversed the Tax Court Opinion. On July 22, 2019, Altera Corp. filed a petition for a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit denied Altera Corp.’s petition for rehearing its case. The Company accordingly recognized tax expense of $26.6 million related to changes in uncertain tax positions during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company reversed this expense entirely during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carryback of its 2020 net operating loss as allowable under the CARES Act.
In addition, in June 2018, the Company reached a preliminary settlement with certain tax authorities with regard to a transfer pricing audit. The Company used the new information obtained in the settlement to remeasure its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits in other jurisdictions relating to similar positions. The net impact to the provision for income taxes in 2018 as a result of the settlement and remeasurement was $34.6 million. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s 2008 to 2019 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and its 2014 to 2019 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. The Company remains subject to possible examination in various other jurisdictions that are not expected to result in material tax adjustments.
The Company’s policy with respect to its undistributed foreign subsidiaries’ earnings is to consider those earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) required a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profit. Correspondingly, all undistributed earnings were deemed to be taxed in 2017 and distribution of the unremitted earnings will not have any significant U.S. federal and state income tax impact. The Company has not provided for the remaining tax effect, if any, of limited outside basis differences of its foreign subsidiaries. The determination of the future tax consequences of the remittance of these earnings is not practicable.
Note 15. Net Loss per Share
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts):
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 20 votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into a share of Class A common stock voluntarily at any time by the holder, and automatically upon certain events. The Class A common stock has no conversion rights. As the liquidation and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
dividend rights are identical for Class A and Class B common stock, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportional basis and the resulting net loss per share attributable to common stockholders will, therefore, be the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.
There were no preferred dividends declared or accumulated for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. As of December 31, 2018, RSUs to be settled in 54.7 million shares of Class B common stock and warrants to purchase 0.2 million shares of Class B common stock, were outstanding, respectively, and were excluded from the table below because they are subject to performance conditions that were not achieved as of this date. As of December 31, 2019, RSUs to be settled in 70.2 million shares of Class B common stock and 0.6 million restricted stock awards were excluded from the table below because they are subject to performance conditions that were not achieved as of such date. As of December 31, 2020, RSUs to be settled in 12.0 million shares of Class A common stock and 0.5 million restricted stock awards were excluded from the table below because they are subject to performance conditions that were not achieved as of such date.
Additionally, the following securities were not included in the computation of diluted shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive (in thousands):
Note 16. Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan that covers substantially all of its domestic employees. The plan allows U.S. employees to make voluntary pre-tax contributions in certain investments at the discretion of the employee, up to maximum annual contribution limits established by the U.S. Department of Treasury. The Company matched a portion of employee contributions totaling $8.3 million, $20.6 million, and $22.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Both employee contributions and the Company’s matching contributions are fully vested upon contribution.
Note 17. Related Party Transactions
An executive officer of the Company served on the board of directors of a payment processing vendor. The Company is party to a merchant agreement with the vendor whereby the Company earns transaction fees and incentives for offering its services to its customers in certain markets and satisfying certain base requirements pursuant to the agreement. The Company applies the transaction fees and incentives received to partially offset the merchant fees charged by the vendor. Net expense with this vendor was $19.5 million, $130.8 million, and $210.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, and was included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, amounts due to this vendor were $17.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively.
This individual was an executive officer of the Company until March 1, 2020, at which time this individual ceased being an executive officer and was appointed to the Company’s board of directors.

Note 19. Restructuring
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced significant economic challenges associated with a severe decline in bookings, resulting primarily from COVID-19 and overall global travel restrictions. To address these impacts, in May 2020, the Company’s management approved a restructuring plan to realign the Company’s business and strategic priorities based on the current market and economic conditions as a result of COVID-19. This worldwide restructuring plan included a 25% reduction in the number of full-time employees, or approximately 1,800 employees, as well as a reduction in the contingent workforce and amendments to certain commercial agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $151.4 million in restructuring charges, of which $103.8 million was related to severance and other employee costs, $35.8 million was related to lease impairments, and $11.8 million was primarily related to contract amendments and terminations. These expenses are included in restructuring charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and unpaid amounts are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. While some of these activities are ongoing and are expected to be completed during 2021, the majority of these actions were completed by December 31, 2020. As December 31, 2020, the remaining liability for restructuring-related costs was not material.
