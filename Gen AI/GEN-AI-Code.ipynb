            "      \"718413-section_1: regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC\\u2019s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank was considered \\u201cwell capitalized\\u201d under FDICIA\\u2019s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements. (See Note 23 to the Company\\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Bank\\u2019s regulatory capital ratios.)\\nSafety and Soundness Regulations. Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify, monitor, and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the safety and soundness regulations include enforcement provisions, including authority for the bank regulatory agencies to require a financial institution in some circumstances to create and implement a compliance plan.\\nDeposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, previously all FDIC insured depository institutions were required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The FDIC discontinued collection of these payments in March 2019.\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment formula for determining deposit insurance premiums and modified certain insurance coverage provisions of the FDIA. The FDIC\\u2019s implementing rules, which redefined the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, became effective April 1, 2011. The Bank\\u2019s total FDIC insurance assessment for 2020 was $300,643.\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 the maximum per depositor FDIC insurance amount.\\nBrokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA\\u2019s prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the \\u201cone-way\\u201d purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling approximately $4.9 million in exchanged funds and $0 in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits. The Company had $4.2 million in purchased wholesale deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Company\\u2019s Asset, Liability and Funds Management Policy limits the use of brokered deposits to 5% of total assets.\\nUSA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cooperatively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

Some of the activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking are: (1) making and servicing loans that could be made by mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring companies; (2) performing the functions of a trust company; (3) certain leasing of real or personal property; (4) providing certain financial, banking or economic data processing services; (5) except as otherwise prohibited by law, acting as an insurance agent or broker with respect to insurance that is directly related to the extension of credit or the provision of other financial services or, under certain circumstances, with respect to insurance that is sold in certain small communities in which the bank holding company system maintains banking offices; (6) acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance and credit health and accident insurance directly related to extensions of credit by the holding company system; (7) providing certain kinds of management consulting advice to unaffiliated banks and non-bank depository institutions; (8) performing real estate appraisals; (9) issuing and selling money order and similar instruments and travelers checks and selling U.S. Savings Bonds; (10) providing certain securities brokerage and related services for the account of bank customers; (11) underwriting and dealing in certain government obligations and other obligations such as bankers\\u2019 acceptances and certificates of deposit; (12) providing consumer financial counseling; (13) providing tax planning and preparation services; (14) providing check guarantee services to merchants; (15) operating a collection agency; and (16) operating a credit bureau. Trust and investment management activities conducted through a non-depository trust company such as the Company\\u2019s affiliate, CFSG, are also considered by the FRB to be permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking.\\nExcept for CFSG\\u2019s trust and investment management operations, the Company does not presently engage, directly or indirectly through any affiliate, in any other permissible non-banking activities.\\nA bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval in order to purchase or redeem its own stock if the gross consideration to be paid, when added to the net consideration paid by the company for all purchases or redemptions by the company of its equity securities within the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the company\\u2019s consolidated net worth.\\nThe Company is required to file with the FRB annual and quarterly reports and such additional information as the Board may require pursuant to the Act. The Board may also make examinations of the Company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company.\\nThe Company, the Bank, CFS Partners and CFSG are all considered \\u201caffiliates\\u201d of each other for the purposes of Section 18(j) of the FDIA, as amended, and Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank\\u2019s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.\\nCapital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in on January 1, 2019, for the Company and the Bank.\\nThe Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:\\n\\u25cf\\na new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;\\n\\u25cf\\na Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);\\n\\u25cf\\na total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and\\n\\u25cf\\na leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).\\nUnder the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out\"\n",

The Company\\u2019s accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, established and maintained by Management, are under the general oversight of the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors, including the Board of Directors\\u2019 Audit Committee.\\nManagement has made a comprehensive review, evaluation, and assessment of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. The standard measures adopted by Management in making its evaluation are the measures in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon its review and evaluation, Management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\\nIn accordance with relief granted to non-accelerated filers as defined in SEC Release No. 34-88365, this Annual Report does not contain an attestation report of the Company\\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm regarding management\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\\nItem 9B.\",\n",

            "      \"718413-section_1: disclosures in its periodic reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC.\\nDividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank\\u2019s net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank\\u2019s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank\\u2019s ALL.\\nThe Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.\\nThe FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company\\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.\\nThe CARES Act and Other Initiatives Related to COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which provided approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the CARES Act\\u2019s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of financial institutions like the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the FRB and other federal bank regulatory authorities. These rules and other subsequent regulatory initiatives have provided guidance on the implementation, eligibility requirements and terms of the various CARES Act programs, as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. It is possible that Congress will enact additional COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act, including the PPP and guidance on certain TDRs discussed below, as well as other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nPaycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act amended the SBA\\u2019s loan programs to create the PPP, a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans, which bear a mandated fixed annual interest rate of one percent, are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, no collateral or personal guarantees are required. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the \\u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021\\u201d (the \\u201cCAA\\u201d) that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the \\u201cHHSB Act\\u201d). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. The Bank has participated in both rounds of PPP lending.\\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers. The CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that may otherwise be required to be characterized as TDRs and to suspend any related determination if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications are related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurs between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency or January 1, 2022. During 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19. The Bank has followed this guidance in providing relief to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nEffect on Regulatory Capital. On September 29, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that neutralizes the regulatory capital and liquidity coverage ratio effects of participating in certain COVID-19 liquidity facilities due to the fact there is no credit or market risk associated with exposures pledged to such facilities. As a result, the final rule supports the flow of credit to households and businesses affected by COVID-19.\\nDodd-Frank Act.

We tested certain internal controls over the Company\\u2019s revenue process, including controls related to the recognition and consolidation of global revenue amounts. We tested a sample of individual revenue transactions by comparing the amounts recognized by the Company to relevant underlying documentation such as contracts. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue.\\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 1959.\\nKansas City, Missouri\\nFebruary 19, 2020\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOperations of Seaboard Corporation and its Subsidiaries\\nSeaboard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, \\u201cSeaboard\\u201d) together comprise a diverse global agribusiness and transportation company. In the United States (\\u201cU.S.\\u201d), Seaboard is primarily engaged in hog production and pork processing and ocean transportation. Overseas, Seaboard is primarily engaged in commodity merchandising, grain processing, sugar and alcohol production and electric power generation. Seaboard also has an equity method investment in Butterball, LLC (\\u201cButterball\\u201d), a producer and processor of branded and non-branded turkey products. Approximately 77% of the outstanding common stock of Seaboard is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Investments in Affiliates\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Seaboard Corporation and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in non-controlled affiliates where we have significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Financial information from certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity. As Seaboard conducts its agricultural commodity trading business with third parties, consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates on an interrelated basis, cost of sales on affiliates cannot be clearly distinguished without making numerous assumptions, primarily with respect to mark-to-market accounting for commodity derivatives.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, potential write down related to investments in and advances to affiliates and notes receivable from affiliates, income taxes, lease liabilities and right of use (\\u201cROU\\u201d) assets and accrued pension liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation\\nSeaboard has operations in several foreign countries, and the currencies of the countries fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Certain of the major contracts and transactions, however, are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates in relation to the currencies of countries where certain of Seaboard\\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates primarily conduct business. These fluctuations result in exchange gains and losses. The activities of these foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily conducted with U.S. subsidiaries or operate in hyper-inflationary environments. As a result, the financial statements of certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are re-measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Certain CT&M segment consolidated subsidiaries located in Brazil, Canada, Guyana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia use local currency as their functional currency. Also, certain non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates of the CT&M and Sugar and Alcohol segments use local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated at average rates. Translation gains and losses are recorded as components of other comprehensive income (loss). For the consolidated subsidiaries and non-consolidated affiliates, U.S. dollar denominated net asset or liability conversions to the local currency are recorded through income.\\nGAAP requires the use of highly inflationary accounting for countries whose cumulative three-year inflation exceeds 100%. In the second quarter of 2018, the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar, which along with increased inflation, indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in that country exceeded 100%. As a result, Seaboard adopted highly inflationary accounting as of July 1, 2018 for Seaboard\\u2019s Sugar and Alcohol segment. Under highly inflationary accounting, the Sugar and Alcohol segment\\u2019s functional currency became the U.S. dollar, and its income statement and balance sheet are measured in U.S. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), net. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard recognized $(3) million and $9 million in foreign currency gains (losses) related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting as a result of its net monetary liability position.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, management considers all demand deposits, overnight investments and other investments with original maturities less than three months as cash equivalents.\\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $137 million, all included in net cash from operating activities. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of finance lease liabilities was $3 million, with principal payments of $2 million included in financing activities and interest of $1 million included in operating activities. Seaboard reports the amortization of ROU assets and the change in operating lease liabilities in other liabilities, exclusive of debt in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified operating and finance lease liabilities were $95 million and $46 million, respectively, for the year\",\n",

            "      \"88121-section_8: S.A. (\\u201cCereoil\\u201d) filed a suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard and Seaboard\\u2019s subsidiaries, Seaboard Overseas Limited (\\u201cSOL\\u201d) and Seaboard Uruguay Holdings Ltd. (\\u201cSeaboard Uruguay\\u201d). Seaboard has a 45% indirect ownership of Cereoil. The suit seeks an order requiring Seaboard, SOL and Seaboard Uruguay to reimburse Cereoil the amount of $22 million, contending that deliveries of soybeans to SOL pursuant to purchase agreements should be set aside as fraudulent conveyances. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and its two subsidiaries could be ordered to pay the amount of $22 million. Any award in this case would offset against any award in the additional case described below filed by the Trustee on April 27, 2018.\\nOn April 27, 2018, the Trustee for Cereoil filed another suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard, SOL, Seaboard Uruguay, all directors of Cereoil, including two individuals employed by Seaboard who served as directors at the behest of Seaboard, and the Chief Financial Officer of Cereoil, an employee of Seaboard who also served at the behest of Seaboard (collectively, the \\u201cCereoil Defendants\\u201d). The Trustee contends that the Cereoil Defendants acted with willful misconduct to cause Cereoil\\u2019s insolvency, and thus should be ordered to pay all liabilities of Cereoil, net of assets. The bankruptcy filing lists total liabilities of $53 million and assets of $30 million. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants could be ordered to pay the amount of the net indebtedness of Cereoil, which based on the bankruptcy schedules would total $23 million. It is possible that the net indebtedness could be higher than this amount if Cereoil\\u2019s liabilities are greater than $53 million and/or Cereoil\\u2019s assets are worth less than $30 million.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIn addition, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance could order payment of the Trustee\\u2019s professional fees, interest, and other expenses. Any award in this case would offset against any award in the case described above filed on March 20, 2018.\\nA creditor of Cereoil which has a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding pending in Uruguay of approximately $10 million, plus accrued interest, has threatened to bring legal action in the U.S. against Seaboard alleging on various legal theories that Seaboard is responsible for this same indebtedness. Seaboard will vigorously defend this action should it be brought.\\nOn May 15, 2018, the Trustee for Nolston S.A. (\\u201cNolston\\u201d) filed a suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants. Seaboard has a 45% indirect ownership of Nolston. The Trustee contends that the Cereoil Defendants acted with willful misconduct to cause Nolston\\u2019s insolvency, and thus should be ordered to pay all liabilities of Nolston, net of assets. The bankruptcy filing lists total liabilities of $29 million and assets of $15 million. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants could be ordered to pay the amount of the net indebtedness of Nolston, which based on the bankruptcy schedules would total $14 million. It is possible that the net indebtedness could be higher than this amount if Nolston\\u2019s liabilities are greater than $29 million and/or Nolston\\u2019s assets are worth less than $15 million. In addition, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance could order payment of the Trustee\\u2019s professional fees, interest, and other expenses.\\nOn September 18, 2014, and subsequently in 2015 and 2016, Seaboard received a number of grand jury subpoenas and informal requests for information from the Department of Justice, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (\\u201cAFMLS\\u201d), seeking records related to specified foreign companies and individuals. The companies and individuals as to which the requested records relate were not affiliated with Seaboard, although Seaboard has also received subpoenas and requests for additional information relating to an affiliate of Seaboard. During 2017, Seaboard received grand jury subpoenas requesting documents and information related to money transfers and bank accounts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries and requests to interview certain Seaboard employees and to obtain testimony before a grand jury. Seaboard retained outside counsel and cooperated with the government\\u2019s investigation. There has been no further communication from AFMLS for more than 18 months and to the knowledge of Seaboard, there has been no further action taken by AFMLS. As such, unless further communication is received from AFMLS or action is taken by AFMLS, disclosure of the matter described in this paragraph will not appear in Seaboard\\u2019s future SEC periodic reports.\\nSeaboard is subject to various administrative and judicial proceedings and other legal matters related to the normal conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these items is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of Seaboard.\\nGuarantees\\nCertain of the non-consolidated affiliates and third-party contractors who perform services for Seaboard have bank debt supporting their underlying operations. From time to time, Seaboard will provide guarantees of that debt in order to further Seaboard\\u2019s business objectives. Seaboard does not issue guarantees for compensation. As of December 31, 2019, guarantees outstanding were not material. Seaboard has not accrued a liability for any of the guarantees as management considers the likelihood of loss to be remote.

If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories of the Pork segment, inventories would have been higher by $64 million and $58 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The LIFO valuation reserve activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\\nNote 5 - Net Property, Plant and Equipment\\nThe following table is a summary of property, plant and equipment:\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFinance lease ROU assets of $50 million, net of $3 million in accumulated amortization, are included in property, plant and equipment and comprise all of the contract growers asset category, with the remaining balance in buildings, machinery and equipment and land.\\nSeaboard\\u2019s capitalized interest on construction in progress was $7 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nNote 6 - Leases\\nSeaboard\\u2019s operating leases are primarily for ports, vessels, contract grower assets, and to a lesser extent, land, buildings and machinery and equipment. Seaboard\\u2019s finance leases are primarily for contract grower assets. Seaboard\\u2019s Marine segment leases its PortMiami terminal, among other ports. The Marine and CT&M segments lease vessels for use in operations. The Pork segment has contract grower agreements in place with farmers to raise a portion of Seaboard\\u2019s hogs using the farmer\\u2019s buildings, land and equipment. Seaboard\\u2019s nonlease components are primarily for services related to labor associated with caring for hogs in its contract grower agreements and crew services on vessel charter arrangements.\\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term for Seaboard\\u2019s operating and finance leases was approximately six years and nine years, respectively. Seaboard\\u2019s lease terms vary depending upon the class of asset and some leases include options to extend or terminate. Since Seaboard is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal or termination options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments or penalties are excluded from lease payments.\\nSeaboard\\u2019s operating lease assets and liabilities are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet. The classification of Seaboard\\u2019s finance leases in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:\\nThe components of lease cost for 2019 were as follows:\\nOperating lease cost and short-term lease cost are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease cost is recognized based on the effective interest method for the lease liability and straight-line amortization of the ROU asset. Variable lease payments are recognized when the circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs. Variable lease payments are primarily for payments in excess of minimums with regards to throughput of shipping containers. Short-term leases are primarily for containers and vessels at Seaboard\\u2019s Marine segment. Lease cost is included in various line items in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or capitalized to inventory. Rental expense for leases with terms of a month or less are excluded from the total lease cost above.\\nRental expense for facility and equipment operating leases for all segments was $46 million and $44 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Marine and CT&M segments\\u2019 vessel charter hire expenses during 2018 and 2017 totaled $111 million and $96 million, respectively. The Pork segment paid $48 million and $37 million for contract grower agreements in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\\nSeaboard\\u2019s weighted average discount rate for operating and finances leases was 6.58% and 6.31%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. There were estimates and judgments made in determining Seaboard\\u2019s multiple discount rates based on term, country and currency, including developing a secured credit rating and spreading market yield data across maturities and country risk-free rates.\\nBelow is Seaboard\\u2019s commitments table as of December 31, 2018 that disclosed operating lease payments for the next five years and thereafter. Seaboard had no material capital leases as of December 31, 2018.\\nNote 7 - Equity Method Investments\\nSeaboard has several investments in and advances to non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates that are all accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 15 for detail of the investments in and advances to affiliates by segment. Financial information from certain foreign affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity.\\nThe Pork segment has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily\\u2019s Premium Meats, LLC (\\u201cDaily\\u2019s\\u201d) and STF. Daily\\u2019s produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon. STF operates a pork processing plant, which began operations in September 2017. Seaboard\\u2019s Pork segment supplies raw materials to both of these facilities for processing and provides marketing services to STF for its pork products. Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard\\u2019s years ended is included in the table above.\\nSeaboard and Triumph Foods, LLC (\\u201cTriumph\\u201d) formed STF in May 2015 with equal ownership of 50%. In connection with the development and operation of the plant, Seaboard contributed $73 million during 2017. Also, Seaboard agreed to provide a portion of the hogs to be processed at the plant. The Pork segment currently has a business relationship with Triumph under which Seaboard markets substantially all of the pork products produced at Triumph\\u2019s plant in Missouri and STF\\u2019s plant in Iowa.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe CT&M segment has noncontrolling interests in foreign businesses conducting flour, maize and feed milling, baking operations, poultry production\",\n",
            "      \"88121-section_7: in estimate could result in a material adverse or favorable impact on the financial statements.\\nAccrued Pension Liability - The measurement of Seaboard\\u2019s pension liability and related expense is dependent on a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding future events. These assumptions include discount rates, assumed rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality rates and retirement rates. The discount rate and return on plan assets are important elements of liability and expense measurement and are reviewed on an annual basis. The effect of decreasing both the discount rate and assumed rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points would be a decrease in pension expense of approximately $1 million per year. The effects of actual results differing from the assumptions (i.e. gains or losses) are primarily accumulated in accrued pension liability and amortized over future periods if it exceeds the 10% corridor and, therefore, could affect Seaboard\\u2019s recognized pension expense in such future periods, as permitted under GAAP. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the pension rates and assumptions.\\nItem 7A.\"\n",

Controls and Procedures\\nAs of December 31, 2019, Seaboard\\u2019s management has evaluated, under the direction of its chief executive and chief financial officers, the effectiveness of Seaboard\\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \\u201cExchange Act\\u201d) Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, Seaboard\\u2019s chief executive and chief financial officers concluded that Seaboard\\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. It should be noted that any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of any such system, there can be no assurance that any design will always succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\\nManagement\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThe management of Seaboard is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision, and with the participation of management and its Internal Audit Department, Seaboard conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\\u201cCOSO\\u201d). Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that Seaboard\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 64.\\nChange in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -There have been no changes in Seaboard\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Seaboard\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\\nSeaboard Corporation:\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Seaboard Corporation and subsidiaries\\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company\\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\\u201d Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nKansas City, Missouri\\nFebruary 19, 2020\\nItem 9B.\",\n",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842).\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nEvaluation of lease liabilities\\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\\u2019s lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were $528 million. The lease liability represents the obligation to make the lease payments arising from leases, measured on a discounted basis, using an estimated incremental borrowing rate.\\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\\u2019s lease liability recorded as of January 1, 2019, the transition date for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), to be a critical audit matter.\\nSpecialized skills were required to evaluate the Company\\u2019s assumptions used to determine the lease liability, specifically the incremental borrowing rates.\\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\\u2019s lease liability determination process including controls to evaluate the incremental borrowing rates used to calculate the lease liability. We involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in understanding the Company\\u2019s methodology and assumptions used to determine the incremental borrowing rates. The valuation professional also assisted us in developing an independent estimate of the incremental borrowing rates. We compared the independent estimate of the incremental borrowing rates to those utilized by the Company, and we performed sensitivity analyses over the incremental borrowing rates to assess the impact on the Company\\u2019s calculation of the lease liability.\\nEvaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue\\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company earned $6.8 billion of revenue in 2019. The revenue was primarily generated by the Pork, Commodity, Trading and Milling, Marine, Sugar and Alcohol, and Power reporting segments. Within these reporting segments, the Company has operating locations associated with consolidated entities in over 45 countries. Revenue generated based on the location of the operations sourcing the product or service primarily resides within the United States, Colombia, and South Africa, and comprised 42% of revenue. The remaining 58% of revenue was sourced from other countries throughout the Caribbean, Central, and South America, Africa, Pacific Basin and Far East, Canada/Mexico, Europe, and other countries.\\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. The geographical dispersion of revenue required especially subjective auditor judgment in determining which locations to perform procedures and evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence. Furthermore, given the time zone, language and business composition differences between countries, our audit team consisted of auditors located in multiple countries around the world.\\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following.

In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue.\\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 1959.\\nKansas City, Missouri\\nFebruary 19, 2020\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOperations of Seaboard Corporation and its Subsidiaries\\nSeaboard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, \\u201cSeaboard\\u201d) together comprise a diverse global agribusiness and transportation company. In the United States (\\u201cU.S.\\u201d), Seaboard is primarily engaged in hog production and pork processing and ocean transportation. Overseas, Seaboard is primarily engaged in commodity merchandising, grain processing, sugar and alcohol production and electric power generation. Seaboard also has an equity method investment in Butterball, LLC (\\u201cButterball\\u201d), a producer and processor of branded and non-branded turkey products. Approximately 77% of the outstanding common stock of Seaboard is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Investments in Affiliates\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Seaboard Corporation and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in non-controlled affiliates where we have significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Financial information from certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity. As Seaboard conducts its agricultural commodity trading business with third parties, consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates on an interrelated basis, cost of sales on affiliates cannot be clearly distinguished without making numerous assumptions, primarily with respect to mark-to-market accounting for commodity derivatives.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, potential write down related to investments in and advances to affiliates and notes receivable from affiliates, income taxes, lease liabilities and right of use (\\u201cROU\\u201d) assets and accrued pension liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation\\nSeaboard has operations in several foreign countries, and the currencies of the countries fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Certain of the major contracts and transactions, however, are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates in relation to the currencies of countries where certain of Seaboard\\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates primarily conduct business. These fluctuations result in exchange gains and losses. The activities of these foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily conducted with U.S. subsidiaries or operate in hyper-inflationary environments. As a result, the financial statements of certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are re-measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Certain CT&M segment consolidated subsidiaries located in Brazil, Canada, Guyana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia use local currency as their functional currency. Also, certain non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates of the CT&M and Sugar and Alcohol segments use local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated at average rates. Translation gains and losses are recorded as components of other comprehensive income (loss). For the consolidated subsidiaries and non-consolidated affiliates, U.S. dollar denominated net asset or liability conversions to the local currency are recorded through income.\\nGAAP requires the use of highly inflationary accounting for countries whose cumulative three-year inflation exceeds 100%. In the second quarter of 2018, the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar, which along with increased inflation, indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in that country exceeded 100%. As a result, Seaboard adopted highly inflationary accounting as of July 1, 2018 for Seaboard\\u2019s Sugar and Alcohol segment. Under highly inflationary accounting, the Sugar and Alcohol segment\\u2019s functional currency became the U.S. dollar, and its income statement and balance sheet are measured in U.S. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), net. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard recognized $(3) million and $9 million in foreign currency gains (losses) related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting as a result of its net monetary liability position.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, management considers all demand deposits, overnight investments and other investments with original maturities less than three months as cash equivalents.\\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $137 million, all included in net cash from operating activities. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of finance lease liabilities was $3 million, with principal payments of $2 million included in financing activities and interest of $1 million included in operating activities. Seaboard reports the amortization of ROU assets and the change in operating lease liabilities in other liabilities, exclusive of debt in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified operating and finance lease liabilities were $95 million and $46 million, respectively, for the year\"\n",

Seaboard had 2,308 stockholders of record of its common stock as of January 31, 2020.\\nStock Performance Chart\\nThe SEC requires a five-year comparison of stock performance for Seaboard with that of an appropriate broad equity market index and similar industry index. Since there is no single industry index to compare stock performance, the companies comprising the Dow Jones U.S. Food Products and Dow Jones U.S. Marine Transportation Industry indices (the \\u201cPeer Group\\u201d) were chosen as the second comparison.\\nThe following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return for Seaboard Corporation, the NYSE American Index and the companies comprising the Peer Group, weighted by market capitalization for the five fiscal years commencing December 31, 2014 and ending December 31, 2019.\\nThe comparison of cumulative total returns presented in the above graph was plotted using the following index values and common stock price values:\\nIn each of the four quarters of 2019, Seaboard declared and paid quarterly dividends of $2.25 per share of common stock. In each of the four quarters of 2018 and 2017, Seaboard declared and paid quarterly dividends of $1.50 per share of common stock. Seaboard\\u2019s Board of Directors intends that Seaboard will continue to pay quarterly dividends for the reasonably foreseeable future, with the amount of any dividends being dependent upon such factors as Seaboard\\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and current and anticipated cash needs, including capital requirements. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, Seaboard\\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by debt agreements.\\nSeaboard has not established any equity compensation plans or individual agreements for its employees under which Seaboard common stock, or options, rights or warrants with respect to Seaboard common stock, may be granted.\\nAs of December 31, 2019, Seaboard may repurchase up to $78 million of its common stock at market value from time to time in open market or privately negotiated purchases under its share repurchase program. There were no purchases made by or on behalf of Seaboard or any \\u201caffiliated purchaser\\u201d (as defined by applicable rules of the SEC) of shares of Seaboard\\u2019s common stock during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories of the Pork segment, inventories would have been higher by $64 million and $58 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The LIFO valuation reserve activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\\nNote 5 - Net Property, Plant and Equipment\\nThe following table is a summary of property, plant and equipment:\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFinance lease ROU assets of $50 million, net of $3 million in accumulated amortization, are included in property, plant and equipment and comprise all of the contract growers asset category, with the remaining balance in buildings, machinery and equipment and land.\\nSeaboard\\u2019s capitalized interest on construction in progress was $7 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nNote 6 - Leases\\nSeaboard\\u2019s operating leases are primarily for ports, vessels, contract grower assets, and to a lesser extent, land, buildings and machinery and equipment. Seaboard\\u2019s finance leases are primarily for contract grower assets. Seaboard\\u2019s Marine segment leases its PortMiami terminal, among other ports. The Marine and CT&M segments lease vessels for use in operations. The Pork segment has contract grower agreements in place with farmers to raise a portion of Seaboard\\u2019s hogs using the farmer\\u2019s buildings, land and equipment. Seaboard\\u2019s nonlease components are primarily for services related to labor associated with caring for hogs in its contract grower agreements and crew services on vessel charter arrangements.\\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term for Seaboard\\u2019s operating and finance leases was approximately six years and nine years, respectively. Seaboard\\u2019s lease terms vary depending upon the class of asset and some leases include options to extend or terminate. Since Seaboard is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal or termination options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments or penalties are excluded from lease payments.\\nSeaboard\\u2019s operating lease assets and liabilities are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet. The classification of Seaboard\\u2019s finance leases in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:\\nThe components of lease cost for 2019 were as follows:\\nOperating lease cost and short-term lease cost are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease cost is recognized based on the effective interest method for the lease liability and straight-line amortization of the ROU asset. Variable lease payments are recognized when the circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs. Variable lease payments are primarily for payments in excess of minimums with regards to throughput of shipping containers. Short-term leases are primarily for containers and vessels at Seaboard\\u2019s Marine segment. Lease cost is included in various line items in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or capitalized to inventory. Rental expense for leases with terms of a month or less are excluded from the total lease cost above.\\nRental expense for facility and equipment operating leases for all segments was $46 million and $44 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Marine and CT&M segments\\u2019 vessel charter hire expenses during 2018 and 2017 totaled $111 million and $96 million, respectively. The Pork segment paid $48 million and $37 million for contract grower agreements in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\\nSeaboard\\u2019s weighted average discount rate for operating and finances leases was 6.58% and 6.31%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. There were estimates and judgments made in determining Seaboard\\u2019s multiple discount rates based on term, country and currency, including developing a secured credit rating and spreading market yield data across maturities and country risk-free rates.\\nBelow is Seaboard\\u2019s commitments table as of December 31, 2018 that disclosed operating lease payments for the next five years and thereafter. Seaboard had no material capital leases as of December 31, 2018.\\nNote 7 - Equity Method Investments\\nSeaboard has several investments in and advances to non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates that are all accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 15 for detail of the investments in and advances to affiliates by segment. Financial information from certain foreign affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity.\\nThe Pork segment has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily\\u2019s Premium Meats, LLC (\\u201cDaily\\u2019s\\u201d) and STF. Daily\\u2019s produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon. STF operates a pork processing plant, which began operations in September 2017. Seaboard\\u2019s Pork segment supplies raw materials to both of these facilities for processing and provides marketing services to STF for its pork products.

As of December 31, 2017, included in cash and cash equivalents are money market fund investments of $21.3 million, which are reported at fair value (Note 5).\\nRestricted Cash\\nAs of December 31, 2018, restricted cash consisted of approximately $234,000, which is held as a security deposit required in conjunction with the lease agreement entered into in October 2017. As of December 31, 2017, restricted cash consisted of approximately $484,000, of which $250,000 is held as collateral for the Company\\u2019s credit card program and $234,000 is held as a security deposit required in conjunction with a lease agreement entered into in October 2017.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Substantially all of the Company\\u2019s cash is held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high-credit quality. Deposits with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.\\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\\nThe Company invests excess cash balances in short-term and long-term marketable securities. The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based on facts and circumstances present at the time of purchase. At each balance sheet date presented, all investments in securities are classified as available-for-sale. The Company reports available-for-sale investments at fair value at each balance sheet date and includes any unrealized holding gains and losses (the adjustment to fair value) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\\u2019 equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is \\u201cother than temporary,\\u201d including the intention to sell and, if so, marks the investment to market through a charge to the Company\\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives:\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset. Through December 31, 2018, no such impairment has occurred.\\nDeferred Rent\\nThe Company\\u2019s operating leases include rent escalation payment terms and other incentives received from landlords. Deferred rent represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense over the term of the lease, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The Company had deferred aggregate rent of $249,000 and $35,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\\nResearch and Development Costs\\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the Company\\u2019s research activities, including discovery efforts, and the development of product candidates, which include:\\n\\u2022\\nexpenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on the Company\\u2019s behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture drug products for use in the Company\\u2019s preclinical and clinical trials;\\n\\u2022\\nsalaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in the Company\\u2019s research and development functions;\\n\\u2022\\ncosts of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;\\n\\u2022\\nthe cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\\n\\u2022\\ncosts related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and\\n\\u2022\\nfacility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. The Company recognizes external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to the Company by its vendors and its clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.\\nWarrants\\nThe Company reviews the terms of all warrants issued and classifies the warrants as a component of permanent equity if they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable, contingently exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its own shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the warrants must require physical settlement and may not provide any guarantee of value or return. Warrants that meet these criteria are initially recorded at their grant date fair value and are not subsequently remeasured. Warrants that do not meet this criteria are classified as liabilities and remeasured to their fair value at each reporting period.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company accounts for all stock-based payment awards granted to employees and nonemployees using a fair value method. The Company\\u2019s stock-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for employee awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the employees\\u2019 requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective July 1, 2018, which aligns the accounting treatment of nonemployee awards with employee awards. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations\",\n",

(the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using a proprietary small molecule nucleotide platform. The Company is developing its most advanced product candidate, inarigivir soproxil (\\u201cinarigivir\\u201d), for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus. Since inception in 2002 and prior to its initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) in May 2016, the Company built its technology platform and product candidate pipeline, supported by grants and through private financings. In September 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc., and in December 2016, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, SBP Securities Corporation.\\nThe Company\\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize approved products, generate revenue, and, ultimately, attain profitable operations. The Company\\u2019s operations to date have been primarily limited to the development of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and the Company\\u2019s other product candidates.\\nBasis of Presentation and Liquidity\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (\\u201cU.S.\\u201d) generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d).\\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $102.1 million and $64.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\\nThe Company expects to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. The Company anticipates that its expenses will increase significantly as it continues to develop inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and its other product candidates. The Company does not have any committed external source of funds. As a result, the Company will need additional financing to support its continuing operations. Adequate additional funds may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholders\\u2019 ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect common stockholder rights. If the Company raises additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc. and SBP Securities Corporation. Sperovie Biosciences, Inc. had operations consisting mainly of legal fees associates with intellectual property activities as of December 31, 2018. SBP Securities Corporation had assets primarily related to investments in marketable securities and operations consisting primarily of interest income as of December 31, 2018. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the accompanying financial statements related to the fair value of marketable securities, common stock and warrant liabilities, accounting for stock-based compensation, income taxes, useful lives of long-lived assets, and accounting for certain accruals. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The Company\\u2019s actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash equivalents are stated at fair value and include short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less\",\n",
            "      \"1566373-section_9A: Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The term \\u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\\u201d as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\\nInherent Limitations of Internal Controls\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement\\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company\\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company\\u2019s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\\n\\u2022\\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\\n\\u2022\\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\\n\\u2022\\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\\u201cCOSO\\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\\nBased on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\\nAs an \\u201cemerging growth company\\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, RSM US LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has not audited or issued an attestation report with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nItem 9B.\",\n",

For the period ended December 31, 2018, the average stock price was $12.71, providing 246,802 dilutive shares for the November 2016 Private Placement Warrants. The change in the fair value of the warrant liability of $4.6 million is included in the net loss available to common shareholders for the diluted net loss per common share amount. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share.\\nThe following potentially dilutive securities outstanding, prior to the use of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, because such securities had an antidilutive impact due to the losses reported:\\n3.\\nINVESTMENTS\\nCash in excess of the Company\\u2019s immediate requirements is invested in accordance with the Company\\u2019s investments policy that primarily seeks to maintain adequate liquidity and preserve capital.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company\\u2019s investments, by category, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\\nA summary of the Company\\u2019s available-for-sale classified investments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):\\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the Company\\u2019s available-for-sale investments, by contract maturity, as of December 31, 2018 consisted of the following (in thousands):\\n4.\\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\\nProperty and equipment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):\\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $288,000 and $158,000, respectively.\\n5.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are performed in a manner to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\\nThe Company classified its money market funds within Level 1 because their fair values are based on their quoted market prices.
