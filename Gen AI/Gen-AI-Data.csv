Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers using our proprietary small molecule nucleotide platform. We design our compounds to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states. We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir soproxil, or inarigivir, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We have designed our antiviral product candidates, including inarigivir, to selectively activate within infected hepatic cells the cellular protein, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that inarigivir, as a RIG-I agonist, could play an important role in antiviral therapy as a result of its dual mechanism of action that is designed to selectively modulate the body’s immune response and inhibit viral replication. We are also developing additional product candidates, including our lead STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) agonist product candidate, SB 11285, which is an immunotherapeutic agent for the potential treatment of selected cancers.
The following table summarizes the status of our development pipeline. We retain exclusive global commercial rights to all of our compounds.
Chronic HBV Program
Chronic HBV infection, which is defined by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, for greater than six months, is a virus most commonly transmitted by contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person. Individuals with chronic HBV are at an increased risk of developing liver cancer, significant liver disease, or permanent scarring of the liver, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. There is no approved cure for chronic HBV. Currently approved, standard of care therapies for the treatment of chronic HBV lack a broadly sustained response following the discontinuation of treatment and have significant limitations. Although treatment with pegylated interferon-a, or PEG-IFN- α, products can ultimately reduce the amount of HBV DNA, or viral load, in the body, this treatment only has a limited effect on the rate of loss or clearance of HBsAg. PEG-IFN- α products also have significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms and fever and, with long term use, can lead to suppression of the production of red and white blood cells, mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects. Additionally, while nucleoside/tide analogue direct-acting oral antiviral agents such as entecavir (marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as Baraclude®), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg (TDF) (marketed by Gilead as Viread®), and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg (TAF) (marketed by Gilead as Vemlidy®), which we collectively refer to as “NUCs,” have demonstrated that they potently suppress HBV DNA, which
generally we refer to as “viral suppression” or “virally-suppressed,” they generally only suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant levels of HBsAg loss or clearance. Additionally, patients taking these NUCs likely require life-long treatment.
Experts and regulators have suggested that a “functional cure,” characterized as either the loss of HBsAg or complete suppression of HBV DNA production, both of which are sustained off therapy, should be the goal of any new curative HBV therapy. A functional cure for chronic HBV with a shorter, finite period of treatment could improve clinical prognosis with a reduction in the risks of cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Inarigivir Clinical Trial Strategy. We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir, an orally-administered hepatic-selective immunomodulator, as a potential backbone in a combinatorial treatment for chronic HBV with the goal to accelerate and substantially increase chronic HBV functional cure rates in a simple, safe and selective manner.
ACHIEVE Trial. We are currently evaluating inarigivir for the treatment of chronic HBV in a global Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial of inarigivir, which we refer to as the ACHIEVE trial. The ACHIEVE trial is being conducted under our first clinical trial supply and collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead. Approximately 80 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV have received doses of 25mg, 50mg, 100mg or 200mg of inarigivir or a placebo as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks, followed by all patients receiving a sequential dose of Viread for 12 weeks. The active-placebo randomization schedule was 4:1 in the inarigivir monotherapy dosing period.
In the first three cohorts (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a 0.5 log10 or greater reduction in HBsAg. Of these 13 responder patients, six were HBeAg-negative (-) patients and seven were HBeAg-positive (+) patients. Additionally, we have observed a dose dependent response of inarigivir on HBV DNA and HBV RNA over the first three cohorts. To date, inarigivir has been well tolerated in the ACHIEVE trial, with no inarigivir-related serious adverse events observed, and no flu-like symptoms or other interferon-like side effects.
All patients in the final 200mg cohort of the ACHIEVE trial have completed dosing of Viread and top-line results from the final 200mg cohort will be presented at The International Liver Congress, the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in April 2019.
Gilead Collaboration. In July 2017, we entered into our second clinical trial collaboration agreement with Gilead under which Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial examining the co-administration of inarigivir and Vemlidy in patients infected with chronic HBV. This clinical trial collaboration was expanded in August 2018 to include two additional cohorts. In the first cohort of this Phase 2 trial, treatment-naive patients received 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 50mg and Vemlidy, while in the second cohort treatment-naive patients are receiving 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 200mg and Vemlidy. In a third cohort, Gilead is evaluating the administration of inarigivir 100mg in virally-suppressed patients who are already are and continue to be treated with a NUC. While we have approved the protocol for this trial under a joint steering committee, Gilead is conducting this trial at their own expense.
CATALYST Trials. We plan to initiate in the first half of 2019 two major Phase 2 global trials examining the administration of inarigivir 400mg in different patient populations and under different dosing regimens. We anticipate that the first global trial will be conducted in Asia and the U.S. and will evaluate non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve HBeAg positive and negative patients infected with chronic HBV who receive inarigivir 400mg as both(i) monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks, and (ii) in combination with Vemlidy for 24 weeks. We refer to this trial as the CATALYST 1 trial. Pre-defined responder patients at week 24 will continue to receive inarigivir 400mg and Vemlidy for up to an additional 24 weeks to determine if they are able to achieve a functional cure.
Concurrent with the CATALYST 1 trial, we plan to initiate a separate trial, which we refer to as the CATALYST 2 trial, in the United Kingdom and Canada examining the use of inarigivir 400mg in non-cirrhotic, virally-suppressed patients currently on a NUC (i) following the cessation of treatment with a NUC, which we refer to as “Stop and Shock” treatment, and (ii) with the continued dosing of a NUC, which we refer to as “Suppress and Shock” treatment. Under the “Stop and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg for 24 weeks and then stop all treatment to evaluate for loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression over time, up to 18 months. Under the “Suppress and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg, in addition to their current NUC treatment, for a period of 24-48 weeks, and again stop all treatment with a follow up to see if there is either loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression off treatment. Pending preliminary results from the CATALYST studies, we plan to conduct a separate “Suppress and Shock” trial in the United States and the European Union, potentially in the second half of 2019. This trial could evaluate the efficacy of inarigivir 400mg over the course of 48 weeks in virally-suppressed patients when compared to the use of a NUC alone.
The CATALYST trial designs allow for evaluation of the likelihood of functional cure and have the potential ability to define the design of Phase 3 trials to allow for a regulatory strategy for the co-administration of inarigivir with a NUC and inarigivir
monotherapy in selected chronic HBV patient populations. The ability to continue treatment for up to 48 weeks and the stopping of treatment with follow up to look for sustained response will define whether inarigivir, when combined with a NUC alone or as a finite monotherapy in “Stop and Shock,” is adequate in either treatment-naïve or virally-suppressed patient populations.
We anticipate reporting interim top-line results from the CATALYST trials throughout 2020 and into 2021.
Fixed-Dose Combination (SB 9225). We are also pursuing the development of SB 9225, a co-formulation of inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, as a potential fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV. We have conducted early development work that indicates compatibility of inarigivir with Viread in the same formulation. We have conducted additional formulation development work for SB 9225 and successfully manufactured initial quantities of SB 9225. The introduction of SB 9225, if approved, could potentially result in enhanced patient compliance and allow for a more favorable safety profile. Subject to the results of our Phase 2 inarigivir trials, we could be in a position to initiate a Phase 3 program for SB 9225 in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2020.
Inarigivir Strategic Collaborations. The treatment of chronic HBV is complex and heterogenous, and we believe that any curative treatment will require a combinatorial approach. Although our initial approach has been to evaluate inarigivir in combination with NUCs (see “Gilead Collaboration” above), we have explored pre-clinical studies of inarigivir with novel drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than a NUC. Accordingly, we intend to enter into additional collaborations to develop inarigivir with products or product candidates that have different pharmacological mechanisms of action than inarigivir or a NUC. Specifically, we are considering novel combination opportunities for inarigivir, including combination with siRNA compounds, core protein allosteric modifiers (CpAMs) and toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors. We anticipate that inarigivir, together with a NUC, will be included in at least one “triple combination” clinical trial with a siRNA compound or a different mechanism in 2019.
Immuno-Oncology Program
We have identified multiple STING agonist compounds as potential immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of selected cancers. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote a strong anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses. We believe that the distinctive chemistry that we use to develop our STING agonists allows for conjugation with other therapeutic modalities, including but not limited to nanoparticle formulation and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, for targeted delivery and potential for improved tolerability, safety and efficacy.
We are developing our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, as a second-generation immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. In our preclinical studies in multiple tumor-derived cell lines, SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of cytokines consistent with engagement of the STING target, as well as cell death and apoptosis. Based on our preclinical studies performed to date, SB 11285 has reduced tumor volumes in multiple rodent tumor models when administered intravenously or intratumorally. These findings lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be administered clinically by either route of administration, and that SB 11285 may be used to target a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites and, if approved, has the potential to be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities to enhance efficacy.
We are currently advancing the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts. Subject to the results of these preclinical studies, we anticipate that we will submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for SB 11285 in the second quarter of 2019, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in cancer later in 2019. SB 11285 could be the first intravenously-administered STING agonist product candidate to enter clinical development.
Intellectual Property Estate
As of December 31, 2018, we had a global intellectual property portfolio consisting of 70 issued patents worldwide and hold multiple patent applications directed to our lead product candidate, together with trade secrets and know-how. As of December 31, 2018, we held one U.S. patent, one European patent and multiple other foreign patents with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir that begin to expire in December 2026 and a second U.S. patent with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir that expires in June 2030, in each case, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions. We hold U.S. and international patent applications with claims covering the composition of matter of SB 11285. If any of these SB 11285 patent applications are issued, the patents would begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions.
Our Technology
Nucleotides and nucleic acids bind to the active sites of proteins as part of normal cellular processes in order to regulate biological functions. Proteins can bind either directly to nucleic acids or indirectly through an alternative nucleic acid-protein complex. Modulating these interactions through agonism (producing or encouraging binding) and antagonism (limiting or discouraging binding) affords potentially broad therapeutic potential and provides an opportunity to target proteins and their biological functions that are typically considered challenging with current modalities.
We design our compounds to modulate the interaction between nucleotides or nucleic acids and proteins. Because our compounds resemble naturally occurring nucleotides and nucleic acids in the body, we believe they can be more efficient in modulating the interactions with proteins through higher selectivity than traditional small molecule approaches.
We have focused our research on the optimization of our novel compounds with favorable drug attributes using various approaches including rational drug design, combinatorial chemistry, structural biology and phenotypic screening approaches. By making specific structural modifications to our compounds, we enable them to bind to targets in the diseased tissues with high affinity and selectivity.
Unlike other nucleic acid-based approaches that act by inhibiting specific protein expression through downregulation of messenger RNA, such as RNA interference, compounds act directly on proteins and therefore can be used to either upregulate or downregulate the activities of the proteins that play a role in disease processes. We have designed inarigivir to bind selectively to and activate RIG-I, a protein that is involved in the activation of the body’s immune response to foreign pathogens.
Some distinguishing features of compounds within our platform include:
•
Novel mechanisms of action. Inarigivir and our other novel compounds are designed to inhibit viral replication through two mechanisms:(i) a direct acting anti-viral (DAA) mechanism where inarigivir acts a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to inhibit the interaction of pre-genomic RNA, or pgRNA, and HBV DNA polymerase within the replication complex; and (ii) binding to RIG-I with activation within the hepatocyte of the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including type I and II interferons. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the protective effects of interferon production. Our compounds are designed to restore interferon production in infected cells. In the case of chronic HBV, we believe that induction of the innate immune response is required for loss or clearance of HBsAg and the achievement of a functional cure.
•
Multiple routes of delivery, including oral administration. Because our novel compounds have small molecule characteristics, they can be delivered orally. Additionally, our compounds potentially may be delivered intravenously and through intra-nasal and inhalation delivery, depending on the target disease. We believe that the versatility of our compounds may allow us to design compounds that use the optimal delivery approach for the target disease.
•
Potential to treat a broad range of viral, inflammatory and oncological diseases. We design our compounds to selectively target certain proteins whose presence or activity contributes to disease severity or causes the underlying disease. We believe that this approach is potentially applicable to a broad range of viral, inflammatory and oncological diseases.
•
Selective immune response. Certain of our compounds are designed to trigger a specific immune response in virally infected cells. To date, we have not observed a nonspecific, extra-hepatic immune response in our completed preclinical and clinical trials of inarigivir. Our STING agonists are designed to activate immune cells for efficient immune-mediated anti-tumor response.
•
Potential for use in combination with other antiviral agents. Because our compounds are designed to act by an immunomodulatory function, we believe they may be developed for use in combination with other antiviral agents that act against viral disease by different mechanisms of action.
Our HBV Program
We have two compounds in development for the treatment of chronic HBV, including our lead product candidate inarigivir. We have designed our HBV product candidates to selectively activate within infected hepatic cells the cellular protein, RIG-I, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense.
Interferon is an immunomodulatory cytokine with potent antiviral activity. Interferon activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in infected cells. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against virus infection before the adaptive immune response is induced. It is well established that the innate immune response is critical to restricting virus replication and infection. The adaptive immune system is part of the overall immune system and is required to eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.
RIG-I is inactive in uninfected cells but is activated when a cell is virally infected. The activation of RIG-I results in the production of interferon within the cells through a well-regulated signaling pathway. Viruses invade cells and are able to replicate and spread because they have mechanisms to block the protective effects of antiviral signaling proteins, such as RIG-I. Viral genomes encode proteins that can block interferon synthesis and signaling, inhibit the function of interferon-induced antiviral proteins and produce interferon receptor decoy molecules to prevent induction of interferon signaling. Thus, by turning off interferon production and function, viruses abrogate the immune response, which enables them to multiply rapidly in cells.
Inarigivir is designed to inhibit viral replication through two mechanisms:(i) a direct acting anti-viral (DAA) mechanism where inarigivir acts a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to inhibit the interaction of pgRNA and HBV DNA polymerase within the replication complex; and (ii) binding to RIG-I with activation within the hepatocyte of the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including type 1 and II interferons. Given these novel host-targeted mechanisms of action of inarigivir and its potential ability to cause the loss or clearance of HBsAg, we plan to develop inarigivir primarily in combination with currently marketed and investigational direct-acting oral antiviral agents or other treatments with differing mechanisms of action.
We have not yet submitted an IND application to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and may not conduct any clinical trial for inarigivir in the United States until we submit an IND to the FDA. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA for inarigivir in 2019.
Current Standard of Care for Chronic HBV Lacks a Sustained Response
There is no approved cure for chronic HBV. The current standard of care treatments for chronic HBV include PEG-IFN-a products and direct-acting oral antiviral agents, which we refer to as NUCs.
A PEG-IFN-a product is an antiviral medication administered by injection in which the chemical substance known as polyethylene glycol, or PEG, is chemically attached to interferon-a to improve the duration of effect of interferon-a. Interferon-a is a protein that interferes with viral replication within host cells. In Europe, PEG-IFN-a products are indicated for first line treatment of chronic HBV virus according to guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver for chronic HBV treatment for certain patient populations. However, PEG-IFN-a products have significant limitations. Although treatment with PEG-IFN-a products can reduce the amount of HBV DNA in the body, the treatment only has a minor effect on the rate of HBsAg reduction or loss. PEG-IFN-a products also have significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms and fever and, with long term use, can lead to suppression of the production of red and white blood cells, mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects.
Direct-acting oral antiviral agents for chronic HBV, such as Baraclude, Viread and Vemlidy, have demonstrated they suppress viral replication. These direct-acting oral antiviral agents are potent suppressors of HBV DNA, but generally only suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant loss or clearance of HBsAg, and patients taking these antiviral agents require potentially life-long treatment.
Experts and regulators have suggested that a “functional cure,” characterized by sustained loss of HBsAg with or without hepatitis B surface antibody conversion, should be the goal of any new curative HBV therapy. Studies have indicated that the current functional cure rate, when combining PEG-IFN-a and Viread over a 48-week treatment period, is less than 10%. According to an article published in the Journal of Hepatology in August 2017, experts believe that for any future treatment to significantly increase the current functional cure rate, an immunomodulatory agent will likely be a necessary component of therapy.
There is a significant unmet need for a chronic HBV treatment that can be administered orally with a favorable safety profile. We believe that the immunomodulatory activity of inarigivir could become a key component of a future combinatorial treatment for patients infected with chronic HBV, potentially increasing the percentage of chronic HBV patients who achieve a functional cure. Specifically, a functional cure with a shorter, finite period of treatment could improve clinical prognosis with a reduction in the risks of cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Early Decline in HBsAg at Week 12 Represents a Key Predictor of Response and Eventual Loss of HBsAg for Interferon and Perhaps Other Immunomodulators in HBV. Reduction in HBsAg following 12 weeks of treatment, either with monotherapy PEG-IFN-a or the combination of PEG-IFN-a with a direct-acting oral antiviral agent, has been reported by researchers as a predictive biomarker of response and eventual loss of HBsAg in patients with chronic HBV.
In a report published in Hepatology in 2013, researchers presented the results of a pooled analysis of over 800 participants from three global HBV trials in which HBsAg decline following 12 weeks of treatment with either monotherapy PEG-IFN-a or the combination of PEG-IFN-a with the oral antiviral Epivir-HBV (lamivudine) was predictive of six-month post-treatment response rates in patients with chronic HBV (26% response rate with HBsAg decline at 12 weeks compared to 14% response rate with no HBsAg decline at 12 weeks). In this analysis, treatment response was defined as a composite endpoint of HBeAg loss with an HBV DNA level <2,000 IU/mL or HBsAg loss at 24 weeks after the end of treatment.
Separately, in November 2014, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)-The Liver Meeting, Gilead presented data from a randomized trial evaluating various treatment cohorts, including monotherapy with PEG-IFN-a, monotherapy with Viread, and the combination of PEG-IFN-a and Viread, in 740 patients with chronic HBV. Overall, HBsAg loss was only observed in patients receiving PEG-IFN-a either alone or in combination with Viread. The combination arm of PEG-IFN-a and Viread demonstrated that only 7.3% of patients had HBsAg loss at Week 48 of treatment, which was predicted by a greater than 0.5log10 reduction in HBsAg at Week 12 of treatment. A 1.0 log10 reduction means a 90% lower virus level in the treated patient from baseline.
Based on the reported findings and inarigivir’s observed ability to induce intracellular interferon signaling pathways, we believe that our assessments of HBsAg decline at Week 12 in our ACHIEVE clinical trial and the clinical trial that Gilead is conducting may be indicative of inarigivir’s ability to cause the loss or clearance of HBsAg in treated patients following a longer duration of treatment.
Novel biomarkers that measure the initial production of pgRNA from covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA, such as serum HBV RNA, are emerging as important early serum predictors of inhibition of viral replication and may help guide combination strategies for clinical trial development and regulatory pathways. Multiple companies developing drug candidates, including siRNAs targeting HBV and HBV-specific capsid inhibitors, are exploring the utility of this novel biomarker. HBV RNA is a secondary endpoint in our ACHIEVE trial to enable us to evaluate its utility as a predictor for HBsAg loss.
Clinical Development of Inarigivir
Inarigivir is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic HBV in multiple worldwide clinical trials. Based on the preclinical and clinical data we have generated to date, as well as the safety demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trial of inarigivir in patients with hepatitis C virus, or HCV, we believe inarigivir may induce an antiviral immune response during chronic HBV infection and cause loss or clearance of HBsAg without the side effects associated with PEG-IFN-a products. We believe that by reducing HBsAg, inarigivir has the potential to provide a functional cure for chronic HBV patients when used in combination with other antiviral agents, thus leading to a finite and shorter duration of treatment.
ACHIEVE Trial. In 2016, we initiated the ACHIEVE trial in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of inarigivir as a monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by treatment with Viread for 12 weeks, in a clinical trial collaboration with Gilead. We conducted the ACHIEVE multi-center clinical trial of inarigivir in Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan to enable us to select appropriate dose level(s) to move forward into additional clinical trials and to provide us with the necessary safety and efficacy data to study the combined use of inarigivir and Viread. The ACHIEVE trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in up to 100 non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV using doses of 25mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg of inarigivir as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks. Following this treatment, all patients will receive treatment with Viread as a monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between an inarigivir dose group or placebo on a 4:1 basis. Patients will be stratified based on HBeAg (+/-) status. HBeAg is a non-structural protein which is secreted by the virus and whose presence in blood, or HBeAg(+), is indicative of wild type or non-mutated virus with high levels of viral replication. The loss of HBeAg occurs secondary to mutations in the virus and results in a patient becoming HBeAg(-) with a resulting lower level of actively replicating virus. The primary endpoints of the ACHIEVE trial are safety and antiviral activity, as measured by the change in HBV DNA at week 12 from baseline. Multiple exploratory secondary endpoints include reduction or loss of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV RNA.
In the first three cohorts (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a 0.5 log10 or greater reduction in HBsAg. Of these 13 responder patients, six were HBeAg-negative (-) patients and seven were HBeAg-positive (+) patients. Additionally, we observed a dose dependent response of inarigivir on HBV DNA and HBV RNA, and of the 16 HBeAg-negative patients who had detectable HBV RNA at baseline, nine had undetectable HBV RNA at the end of the 12-week monotherapy dosing regimen. Blood levels of HBsAg and HBV RNA are generally viewed as biomarkers for the presence of active cccDNA,
which is the major reservoir for chronic HBV and the template for viral replication. Accordingly, reductions in HBsAg and HBV RNA have been associated with clearance of ccc DNA. Inarigivir responses have been proportional to the baseline HBsAg level and we believe are reflective of the mechanism of action of inarigivir as an immunomodulator. Baseline HBsAg level < 10,000 IU (4log10) remains the strongest predictor of response to inarigivir across all cohorts for HBV DNA and HBV RNA reductions irrespective of HBeAg status. This response is consistent with the known role of HBsAg as a down regulator of the host immune response to HBV. To date, inarigivir has been well tolerated in the ACHIEVE trial, with no inarigivir-related serious adverse events observed. Treatment-emergent adverse events have ranged from mild to moderate in severity, with no flu-like symptoms or other interferon-like side effects. One clinical serious adverse event of knee pain likely unrelated to inarigivir and one biochemical event of a transient, non-sustained Grade 3 hypertryglyceridemia were observed.
All patients in the final 200mg cohort of the ACHIEVE trial have completed dosing of Viread and top-line results from the final 200mg cohort will be presented at The International Liver Congress, the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in April 2019.
Gilead Clinical Trial Supply and Collaboration Agreement. In July 2017, we entered into our second collaboration agreement with Gilead, which was amended in August 2018 to expand the collaboration. Under this clinical trial supply and collaboration agreement, Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial examining (i) the co-administration of inarigivir and Vemlidy and (ii) the evaluation of inarigivir in chronic HBV patients whose viral load is suppressed. In the first cohort, 30 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV received 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 50mg and Vemlidy. In the second cohort, up to 30 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV are receiving 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 200mg and Vemlidy. All patients in the first two cohorts will also receive Vemlidy as a monotherapy for 36 weeks. In a third cohort, Gilead is evaluating the administration of inarigivir 100mg in chronic HBV patients whose viral load is suppressed and who are already being treated with a NUC.
CATALYST 1 and CATALYST 2 Trials. We plan to initiate in the first half of 2019 two major Phase 2 global trials examining the administration of inarigivir 400mg in different patient populations and under different dosing regimens.
We anticipate that the first global trial, the CATALYST 1 trial, will be conducted in Asia and the U.S. and will evaluate in up to 60 treatment-naïve HBeAg positive and negative patients. Under this response-guided trial, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following three arms: (i) 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg monotherapy daily for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks; (ii) 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg monotherapy three times per week for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks; and (iii) 30 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg in combination with Vemlidy for 24 weeks. Pre-defined responder patients at week 24 will continue to receive inarigivir 400mg and Vemlidy for up to an additional 24 weeks to determine if they are able to achieve a functional cure.
Concurrent with the CATALYST 1 trial, we plan to initiate the CATALYST 2 trial in the United Kingdom and Canada examining the use of inarigivir 400mg. We anticipate that this trial will evaluate up to 60 virally-suppressed patients currently on a NUC (i) following the cessation of treatment with a NUC, which we refer to as “Stop and Shock” treatment, and (ii) with the continued dosing of a NUC, which we refer to as “Suppress and Shock” treatment. Under the “Stop and Shock” treatment, 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg for 24 weeks and then stop all treatment to evaluate for loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression over time, up to 18 months. Under the response-guided “Suppress and Shock” treatment, 40 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg, in addition to their current NUC treatment, for a period of 24-48 weeks, and again stop all treatment with a follow up to see if there is either loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression off treatment. The CATALYST 2 trial will include specialized fine needle aspirations of the liver to evaluate intra-hepatic immune responses.
Pending preliminary results from the CATALYST studies, we plan to conduct a separate “Suppress and Shock” trial in the United States and the European Union, potentially in the second half of 2019. This trial could evaluate the efficacy of inarigivir 400mg over the course of 48 weeks in virally-suppressed patients when compared to the use of a NUC alone.
The CATALYST trial designs allow for evaluation of the likelihood of functional cure and have the potential ability to define the design of Phase 3 trials to allow for a regulatory strategy for the co-administration of inarigivir with a NUC and inarigivir monotherapy in selected chronic HBV patient populations. The ability to continue treatment for up to 48 weeks and the stopping of treatment with follow up to look for sustained response will define whether inarigivir, when combined with a NUC alone or as a finite monotherapy in “Stop and Shock,” is adequate in either treatment-naïve or virally-suppressed patient populations.
We anticipate reporting interim top-line results from the CATALYST trials throughout 2020 and into 2021.
Liver Biopsy Study. We plan to conduct a single center study in Singapore to evaluate the intra-hepatic activation of the immune response by inarigivir and to correlate immunology findings with the effect on HBV intra-hepatic virology, in particular cccDNA. In this study, eight virally-suppressed patients with chronic HBV will receive inarigivir 400mg daily to three times a week
and have liver biopsies before treatment and at week six on treatment. Liver biopsies will undergo specialized immunology and virology studies to correlate and confirm the intra-hepatic mechanism of action on both immune function and HBV replication. We anticipate reporting initial results from this study in late 2019.
Other Development Efforts for Chronic HBV
SB 9225 Fixed-Dose Combination. We are also pursuing the development of SB 9225, a co-formulation of inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, as a potential fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV. We have conducted early development work that indicates compatibility of inarigivir with Viread in the same formulation. We have conducted additional formulation development work for SB 9225 and successfully manufactured initial quantities of SB 9225. The introduction of SB 9225, if approved, could potentially result in enhanced patient compliance and allow for a more favorable safety profile. Subject to the results of our Phase 2 inarigivir trials, we could be in a position to initiate a Phase 3 program for SB 9225 in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2020.
HBx Antisense Program. Recent scientific literature has established the important role of the HBx gene in the life cycle of the Hepatitis B virus and in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and identified HBx as a promising target for the treatment of HBV. We are developing novel antisense oligonucleotide compounds to block HBx expression in HBV patients. We are evaluating these compounds to assess their potential as product candidates.
Other Strategic Initiatives for Chronic HBV
The treatment of chronic HBV is complex and heterogenous, and we believe that any curative treatment will require a combinatorial approach. Although our initial approach has been to evaluate inarigivir in combination with NUCs (see “Gilead Clinical Trial and Supply Collaboration Agreement” above), we have explored pre-clinical studies of inarigivir with novel drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than a NUC. Accordingly, we intend to enter into additional clinical collaborations with others to develop inarigivir with products or product candidates that have different pharmacological mechanisms of action than inarigivir or NUCs. Specifically, we are considering novel combination opportunities for inarigivir, including combination with siRNA compounds and CpAMs and TLR8 or PD-1 inhibitors. We anticipate that inarigivir, together with a NUC, will be included in at least one “triple combination” clinical trial with a siRNA compound or a different mechanism in 2019.
Immuno-Oncology Program
In addition to our HBV clinical program, we are also developing multiple compounds for the potential treatment of selected cancers.
STING Agonist Program
We have developed multiple STING agonist compounds, which are differentiated cyclic dinucleotides, as potential immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of selected cancers. Immunotherapy has emerged in recent years as a transformative approach for the treatment of cancer because the induction of interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in tumor cells and within the tumor microenvironment is essential for modulating the host-immune response and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote a strong anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses.
SB 11285. We are developing our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, as a second-generation immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. In our preclinical studies in multiple tumor-derived cell lines, SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of cytokines consistent with engagement of the STING target, as well as cell death and apoptosis. Based on our preclinical studies performed to date, SB 11285 has demonstrated efficacy in multiple syngeneic rodent tumor models when administered intravenously or intratumorally. These findings lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be administered clinically by either route of administration and enables SB 11285 to target a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites.
We are currently advancing the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts. We anticipate that we will submit an IND for SB 11285 in the second quarter of 2019, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in cancer later in 2019. SB 11285 could be the first intravenously-administered STING agonist product candidate to enter clinical development.
Combination of STING Agonists with New Therapeutic Modalities. We believe the chemistry used to develop our STING agonists also allows for site-specific conjugation to other therapeutic modalities including antibodies to form antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. The formulation of our STING agonists in combination with an antibody to form an ADC could provide
targeted delivery to the tumor via a bio-reversible linker that is designed to release the STING agonist at the tumor site. We are also developing a nanoparticle formulation for systemic delivery of our STING agonists. In in vitro studies involving the use of a nanoparticle formulation of SB 11285, we have observed potent STING agonist activity. Both of these approaches may distinguish the profile and widen the therapeutic index of SB 11285 by enabling its delivery to the target cells to effect tumor clearance.
RIG-I Agonist Program
Spring Bank is building upon its expertise and experience in discovering and developing inarigivir, a RIG-I agonist, to discover and develop new novel RIG-I agonists specifically for potential oncology indications.
Other Early Research &Development Programs
STING Antagonist Program
In addition to our pipeline of antiviral and immune-oncology product candidates, we plan to explore the use of novel STING antagonist compounds for the treatment of certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our STING antagonists are designed to block aberrant STING-dependent signaling that contribute to inflammatory diseases. We are optimizing different structural classes to develop lead compounds for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our success will depend upon our ability, and upon the ability of any future collaborators of ours, to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the United States and other key pharmaceutical markets around the world for our product candidates and technologies, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We have sought, and plan to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and other key pharmaceutical markets, that is intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We have devoted considerable effort and resources to build a substantial patent estate designed to provide multiple levels of protection for our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we licensed two and owned more than 20 patent families. These patent families include nearly 200 patents and patent applications worldwide, including 12 patents and 38 patent applications in the United States and 58 patents and 90 patent applications outside the United States. Of these patents, four U.S. patents and five patents outside of the United States are subject to our license with BioHEP Technologies Ltd., or BioHEP. The licensed families include the active ingredient in inarigivir, i.e., SB 9000, and methods of assembling libraries of our compounds. Our patents and patent applications include protection for:
•
compositions of matter for our compounds;
•
processes for synthesizing and manufacturing our compounds;
•
methods of using our compounds to treat or prevent disorders such as microbial infections, including dosage forms and formulations and methods relating to course of treatment; and
•
methods of assembling libraries of our compounds.
With respect to inarigivir, as of December 31, 2018, we held one U.S. patent with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir specifically, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treating HBV and methods of preparing inarigivir. This patent is expected to expire in December 2026, without considering any potential patent term extensions. As of December 31, 2018, we also held one U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of inarigivir generically, methods of treating HBV, including combination therapy with other agents and treatment of resistant strains of HBV. With patent term adjustment, this patent is expected to expire in June 2030, without considering any potential patent term extensions. This patent has been granted in the European Patent Office and has been nationalized in all the major countries in Europe. These nationalized patents, when issued, are expected to begin to expire in December 2026. We hold patents that have been granted in China, Japan and Korea with claims covering the active ingredient in inarigivir, and methods of using this compound. These patents are expected to begin to expire in 2022. We also hold patent applications that cover methods of using inarigivir, including in viral infections such as HBV and HCV. These patent applications, if issued, will begin to expire in 2031. In addition, we hold patent applications with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir generically and specifically in China, Europe, Hong Kong and India, which, if issued, are expected to begin to expire in December 2026.
We hold U.S. and foreign patent applications, which include methods of using inarigivir in various diseases, including certain resistant strains of infections such as HBV and HCV. If these patent applications are issued, the patents would be expected to begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term extensions.
We hold U.S. provisional patent applications, international (PCT) patent applications, and foreign patent applications which include claims to compositions of matter and various methods of using our STING agonists, including SB 11285, in oncology. If any of these patent applications are issued, the patents would be expected to begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions.
In each case, we own or hold the exclusive license to the foregoing patents and patent applications. We are not aware of any contested proceeding or third-party claims that cover any of our patents or patent applications.
The actual protection afforded by a particular patent varies from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in which it issued.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering inarigivir may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
BioHEP License
In January 2016, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement, or the amended license agreement, with BioHEP which amended and restated our prior license agreement with BioHEP which we entered into in December 2003. The amended license agreement became effective on February 1, 2016. Under the amended license agreement, BioHEP granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and know-how to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain product candidates comprising a novel phosphorothioate dinucleotide and certain related compounds, which include inarigivir, SB 9400, SB 9941 and SB 9946, for the diagnosis and/or treatment of all viral diseases and conditions.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for conducting all research, development and commercialization activities with respect to licensed products.
Under the terms of the original license agreement, we issued to BioHEP 12,500 shares of our common stock and 1,000,000 shares of our series A preferred stock, which shares of Series A preferred stock were converted into 250,000 shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in May 2016. In connection with entering into the amended license agreement, we issued to BioHEP an additional 125,000 shares of our common stock and issued to BioHEP a warrant to purchase an additional 125,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, which warrant expired unexercised on August 1, 2018. Under the license agreement, BioHEP is eligible to receive up to $3.5 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for disease(s) caused by each distinct virus for which we develop licensed product(s). BioHEP is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low-to-mid single-digits on net product sales of licensed products by us and our affiliates and sublicensees, and a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues we and our affiliates receive from sublicensees, which share of sublicensing revenues is capped at a maximum aggregate of $2.0 million under all such sublicenses.
BioHEP’s royalty rights generally extend on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire of the BioHEP patent rights licensed to us or of patent rights claiming specified improvements that we own that cover the licensed product in the applicable country.
Our agreement with BioHEP will remain in effect until the expiration of all royalty obligations under the agreement with respect to all licensed products in all countries. We may terminate the agreement for our convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice to BioHEP. BioHEP may terminate this agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize products in accordance with the development plan for the
licensed product. The agreement may also be terminated in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified notice period or in the case of specified bankruptcy events involving the other party.
If the agreement is terminated with respect to any one or more country, all licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate only with respect to any such countries and specified rights in such countries will revert to BioHEP.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our compounds or their components. To date, we have only manufactured supplies of drug substance for use in our preclinical studies at our own facilities and have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and finished product to meet our needs for preclinical testing, including toxicology studies and clinical trials. We believe that each of these suppliers has sufficient capacity to meet our needs, and that adequate alternative sources exist. We typically order drug substance and clinical trial supplies on a work order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business.
In the ordinary course of our business, we explore additional sources of supply and believe that we will have additional manufacturer(s) in place in the future for the manufacture of clinical drug supply and the commercial manufacture of inarigivir. If the supply of drug substance is insufficient to complete our trials or we are unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all, our business may be adversely affected. We expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and clinical trial supplies for our compounds for the foreseeable future.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements that govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. We are reliant on our contract manufacturers to comply with these requirements, including manufacturing our compounds for use in clinical trials under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals intended for use in humans.
Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any collaboration or co-promotion arrangements. We may build focused capabilities in the United States to commercialize development programs where we believe that the medical specialists for the indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to promote the product effectively with a targeted sales team. We could engage in strategic relationships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the development of our programs and/or realize greater value for our shareholders due to faster access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.
FDA-approved treatments for patients with chronic HBV include PEG-IFN-a products, including Pegasys® (PEG-IFN a-2a), marketed by Genentech, Inc., and PEG-Intron® (PEG-IFN a-2b), marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., and oral antiviral agents such as the nucleoside analog Baraclude, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and the nucleotide analogs Viread and Vemlidy, marketed by Gilead. In addition, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus, Arrowhead, Assembly Biosciences, Inc., Gilead and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are developing therapies with varying mechanisms of action to address chronic HBV, including non-nucleotide antivirals and non-interferon immune enhancers. We believe that instead of competing with certain of these therapies, inarigivir has the potential to be used as a complementary therapy to certain of the treatments identified above.
There are also FDA-approved vaccinations available for children and high-risk adults that protect against HBV. These vaccines are manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., Dynavax and GlaxoSmithKline Plc and are widely available in the United States (and less available in certain parts of the world) and have limited side effects. Although the vaccines are effective against HBV in non-infected individuals, they do not reverse or cure the disease in people who have already contracted the virus.
Our STING agonist program will face significant competition from companies in the immuno-oncology subsector of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. We are aware that multiple large and small pharmaceutical companies, including Merck
& Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Novartis AG, as well as other companies such as Aduro Biotech, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.
We compete with the biotechnology companies listed above and others in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales and marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of inarigivir, SB 9225, SB 11285 and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of lower cost products.
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
•
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
•
approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•
preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
•
review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
•
satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•
satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•
payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
•
compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any point in development, and depending upon the scope of the hold, clinical trial(s) may not restart until resolution of the outstanding concerns to the FDA’s satisfaction.
In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•
Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
•
Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•
Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate statistically the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
•
Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Review of an NDA by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees typically increase annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “Priority Review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The FDA may extend the review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and using of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if the product is intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review Designation.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if the product is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the FDA may withdraw the Fast Track Designation if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “Breakthrough Therapies.” A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review Designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
Based on the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of an NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•
fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•
refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
•
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug…”
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment of data. FDASIA sets forth the specific timing of the submission of the pediatric study plan. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until the FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent if valid and infringed by the proposed product.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than
what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Review and Approval of Drugs in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Commission and EU Member State Competent Authorities. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, an applicant must obtain the approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than 28 May 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.
Marketing Authorization
In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs:
•
Community MAs, which are issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210-day review period is reduced to 150 days.
•
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the EU
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years based on a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
Similar to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations.
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal products the obligation to conduct a labor-intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies.
The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. In addition, the period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated based on available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our product candidate is approved, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidate could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidate will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
•
the United States federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•
the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•
the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•
the federal transparency requirements known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
•
analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
•
an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
•
expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•
expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
•
addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•
expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
•
established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•
a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•
the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
•
established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since enactment of the PPACA. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went
into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless Congress takes additional action. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Congress and the current presidential administration have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the PPACA. President Trump issued at least one Executive Order and both chambers of Congress passed bills all with the goal of fulfilling these intentions. If full or partial repeal is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the PPACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs.
There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs
We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur significant and increasing losses in the future.
We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing and have not generated any revenue from product sales, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in every reporting period since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we reported a net loss of $22.9 million and $27.7 million, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $102.1 million at December 31, 2018.
We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as our expenses increase, and we expect that our expenses will increase if and as we:
•
continue to develop and conduct clinical trials of our lead product candidate, inarigivir, including our ongoing Phase 2 ACHIEVE clinical trial and our upcoming Phase 2 CATALYST clinical trials of inarigivir for chronic HBV, which we refer to as the ACHIEVE trial and the CATALYST trials, respectively;
•
continue preclinical development of SB 11285, our lead STING agonist product candidate, and initiate clinical trials of SB 11285, if supported by the preclinical data;
•
initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for our other product candidates, including SB 9225, a potential fixed-dose co-formulation product that combines inarigivir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any;
•
require the manufacture and supply of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire and retain additional personnel, including clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company; and
•
add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs.
We currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.
Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend upon our ability to generate revenue. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we are able to gain regulatory approval of and commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we do not
know when we will generate revenue from product sales, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales of any of our product candidates also depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:
•
successfully complete development activities, including filing one or more investigational new drug, or IND, applications, enrollment of trial participants and completion of the necessary clinical trials;
•
enter into arrangements with third parties to further validate our technology and product candidates;
•
complete and submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and obtain regulatory approvals from the FDA for our product candidates in indications for which there is a commercial market;
•
complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, regulatory authorities outside of the United States, or foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates;
•
successfully commercialize any approved products;
•
manufacture or have manufactured commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;
•
develop a commercial organization capable of manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for any products we intend to commercialize using internal resources;
•
enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture, market, sell and distribute our other approved products; and
•
obtain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement from third parties for any approved products, including government and private payors.
Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate, we may not generate revenues that are large enough for us to become profitable. This is in part due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including uncertainties regarding the timing or amount of increased expenses. Even if we are able to complete the development and regulatory process for any of our product candidates, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our pipeline of product candidates or continue our operations. A decline in the value of the Company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.
We intend to expend a significant amount of our limited resources on the development of our sole clinical stage product candidate, inarigivir, for chronic HBV, and may fail to capitalize on other technologies, product candidates or other indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
We are focusing a significant amount of our resources on the development of inarigivir, which concentrates the risk of product failure on one product candidate. Inarigivir may prove to be unsafe or ineffective. Because of this concentration of resources, we may forego or delay development of other technologies, product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to the candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.
We will require additional capital to fund our operations. If we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our development and potential commercialization efforts for our product candidates.
Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate new clinical trials of, initiate new research and preclinical development efforts for and
seek marketing approval for inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and any other product candidates. Even if we obtain marketing approval for any of these product candidates, we may incur significant commercialization expenses.
We plan to continue to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to continue development of our product candidates, particularly inarigivir, SB 11285 and SB 9225. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2021.
We will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy, and we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. We do not have any committed external source of funds.
We have based our capital expenditure estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deploy our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials evaluating inarigivir and SB 9225;
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and, if applicable, clinical trials of SB 11285;
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of any other product candidates we may develop;
•
our obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense payments to third-party licensors under our licensing agreements;
•
the timing, receipt, and amount of milestone payments or royalties, if any, from inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates;
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop;
•
the outcome, timing and cost of seeking regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those we currently expect;
•
the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;
•
subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of inarigivir and any other products;
•
the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;
•
the costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or our other product candidates or technologies.
Until we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and/or alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include provisions that adversely affect the
rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include liens or other restrictive covenants limiting our ability to take important actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Securing additional financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management’s ability to oversee the development of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and our other product candidates.
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-218399), or the S-3 Registration Statement, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $59.6 million (as of December 31, 2018) of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, purchase rights, units, or debt securities, which includes $42.7 in shares issuable pursuant to an at-the-market offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that we established in August 2017. Future sales of securities under the S-3 Registration Statement, including any sales under the at-the-market offering program, could result in dilution of our stockholders and could have a negative impact on our stock price.
If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, and we may be required to issue shares of our capital stock that may dilute our existing stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our technologies that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
We anticipate that we may need to enter into additional collaborations and relationships with strategic and development partners to develop our product candidates and market any approved products and we may be unable to attract additional collaborations with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the development of our product candidates.
We currently do not possess all of the financial and development resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies. Unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing capability, we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize any product candidates that may be approved. A component of our business strategy includes entering into strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to further validate and accelerate the development of our product candidates. We may not be able to attract such partners, and even if we are able to enter into such partnerships, the terms may be less favorable than anticipated. Further, entering into partnership agreements may limit our commercialization options and/or require us to share revenues and profits with our partners, and we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to enter into any of these agreements on commercially attractive terms, we may be unable to develop certain programs due to a limited availability of resources.
Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates
Our future success is substantially dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of inarigivir and/or SB 9225 and will require significant capital resources and years of additional clinical development effort. If we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize inarigivir or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.
We do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. As a result, our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete clinical development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize inarigivir and/or SB 9225 in a timely manner. The success of inarigivir and/or SB 9225 will depend on several factors, including the following:
•
successful completion of our ACHIEVE trial and the successful initiation and completion of our CATALYST trials and other future trials of inarigivir;
•
successful completion of additional studies to support additional clinical trials;
•
initiation and successful enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials;
•
safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;
•
timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the performance of our collaborators;
•
establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers;
•
establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug products that are appropriately packaged for sale;
•
obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval;
•
a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;
•
commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors following any marketing approval; and
•
our ability to compete with other therapies, including therapies targeting viral hepatitis and other antiviral applications.
Many of these factors are beyond our control, including the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of any collaborators. If we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for and successfully commercialize inarigivir and/or SB 9225 or experience delays because of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be substantially harmed.
We plan to conduct multiple clinical trials of inarigivir. If patients in any of these trials experience adverse safety events, we may be required to delay, discontinue or modify all of our clinical trials of inarigivir.
Research and development goals may not be achieved in the time frames that we publicly estimate, which could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause our stock price to decline.
We set goals, and make public statements regarding our expectations, regarding the timing of certain accomplishments, developments and milestones under our research and development programs. The actual timing of these events can vary significantly due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, the amount of time, effort and resources committed to our programs by us and any collaborators and the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval process. As a result, there can be no assurance that we or any collaborators will initiate or complete clinical development activities, make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned or that we or any collaborators will be able to adhere to our current schedule for the achievement of key milestones under any of our programs. If we or any collaborators fail to achieve one or more of the milestones as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock could decline.
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials that we have conducted to date may not be predictive of results in future clinical trials.
The outcome of preclinical studies and clinical trials that we have conducted to date may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies may not translate into human efficacy.
We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of inarigivir in patients with HCV and we will complete by the end of the first quarter of 2019 a Phase 2 dose escalation trial, which we refer to as the ACHIEVE trial, in patients with chronic HBV. In the Phase 1 HCV trial, we evaluated inarigivir in 38 non-cirrhotic HCV infected patients as a monotherapy treatment for up to seven days. In the Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial, we evaluated inarigivir in 65 non-cirrhotic chronically infected HBV patients at a dose up to 200mg as a monotherapy treatment for up to twelve weeks. We expect that the dose and duration of dosing of inarigivir will be different in future clinical trials. For instance, in our planned CATALYST trials, the dose of inarigivir will increase to 400mg and the duration of the investigational therapy will be longer and involve combination therapy with other antiviral agents. As a result, our clinical trial results observed to date may not be indicative of future results in our clinical trials in patients with chronic HBV.
In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of inarigivir, SB 11285 or SB 9225, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for such product candidate, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be negatively impacted.
Interim, ""top-line,"" and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available or as additional analyses are conducted, and the data are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.
From time to time, we may publicly disclose interim or “top-line” from our clinical studies, which are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and safety data. The results and related findings and conclusions we may draw from this top-line data are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete is subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or “top-line” data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes between preliminary, “top-line,” or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate and our Company in general. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. If the top-line or interim data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed or delayed, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.
The therapeutic efficacy of inarigivir, SB 11285 and our other product candidates has not been definitively shown in humans, and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates.
Inarigivir, SB 11285 and our other product candidates are novel compounds and their potential benefit as antiviral drugs, immunotherapies or immunomodulators, as applicable, has not been definitively shown in humans. Inarigivir, SB 11285 and our other product candidates may not prove to be effective against the indications for which they are being designed to act and may not demonstrate in future clinical trials any or all of the pharmacological effects that have been observed in preclinical studies or clinical trials to date.
Inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and our other product candidates may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If any of our product candidates is associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon the development of such product candidate or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Because of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development of novel therapeutic agents, we may never successfully develop or commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates, in which case our business will be harmed.
Clinical development of product candidates involves a lengthy and expensive process. Additionally, there are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize new drugs, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use.
We may experience delays in our ongoing or future preclinical or clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on a timely basis, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, such as the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable.
There can be no assurance that the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities will not put clinical trials of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates on clinical hold now or in the future. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated or may take longer than anticipated for a variety of reasons, such as:
•
delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;
•
delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;
•
delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;

•
inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for competing product candidates with the same indication;
•
failure of our third-party service providers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;
•

•
difficulties in manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;
•
lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; or
•
changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.
We have not yet submitted an IND application to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to any comparable foreign regulatory entity for inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate. We may not conduct any clinical trials for any particular product candidate in the United States until we submit an IND to the FDA for such product candidate. Because we may
develop inarigivir or SB 11285 for multiple indications, we may be required to submit multiple INDs to the FDA for these indications and may not conduct a clinical trial in the United States for that indication unless we do so.
We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule or at all. If we experience delays in any preclinical or clinical trial of our product candidates, the product candidate development and approval process could be slowed down, and as a result the costs of the development and approval process may increase, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from these product candidates may be delayed. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.
If we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.
We or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for any of our product candidates if we or our collaborators, as applicable, are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials as required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and is affected by many factors, including:
•
the size and nature of the patient population;
•
the severity of the disease under investigation;
•
the proximity of patients to clinical sites;
•
the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•
the design of the clinical trial;
•
efforts to facilitate timely enrollment;
•
competing clinical trials; and
•
clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.
For instance, in our Phase 1 clinical trial of inarigivir in patients with HCV, we experienced significant delays in enrollment due to competing clinical trials in patients with HCV being conducted by other biopharmaceutical companies, and the same could occur with respect to our planned HBV clinical trials.
Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, delay or halt the development of and approval processes for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales of and generate revenues from our product candidates, which could cause the value of our Company to decline.
If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
We are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, impose similar restrictions. We may never receive such approvals. We must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we will be able to obtain these approvals.
We have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Furthermore, any inability to complete preclinical and clinical
development successfully could result in additional costs to us and impair our ability to generate revenues. Moreover, if (i) we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing that we, or they contemplate, (ii) we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, (iii) the results of these clinical trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable or (iv) there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we may:
•
be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;
•
not obtain marketing approval at all;
•
obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;
•
obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;
•
be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or
•
be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.
If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of our product candidates, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.
We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates, including:
•
clinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results;
•
we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;
•
the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;
•
the cost of planned clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;
•
our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;
•
regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;
•
we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;
•
patients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial’s duration;
•
we may have to delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate;
•
regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate;
•
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial designs or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;
•
the supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; and
•
the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.
Product development costs for us will increase if we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals and we will be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of our product candidates.
Inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate that we develop may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of an approved label.
Undesirable side effects caused by inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
Results of our trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Study drug-related side effects could affect study subject recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.
If inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.
Our commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of inarigivir as a monotherapy or in combination with other antiviral agents or of any other product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, and the market opportunity for the product candidate may be smaller than we estimate.
Even if we obtain regulatory approval for inarigivir or SB 9225 or any other product candidate in chronic HBV or other indications, our product candidate may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing “standard of care” therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of coverage or reimbursement for existing therapies.
Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including the:
•
efficacy and safety of our product candidates administered with other drugs each as demonstrated in clinical trials and post-marketing experience;
•
clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;
•
potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;
•
safety of our product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications should physicians choose to prescribe for such uses;
•
prevalence and severity of any side effects;
•
product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;
•
timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as of competitive products;
•
cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments;
•
availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;
•
adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products;
•
the convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates as compared to alternative treatments;
•
effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and
•
changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product candidate.
Moreover, if inarigivir or SB 9225 is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, or healthcare providers are restricted, withdrawn or recalled or fail to be approved, as the case may be, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.
There are also FDA-approved vaccinations available for children and high-risk adults that protect against HBV, but do not reverse or cure the disease in people who have already contracted the virus. These vaccines are manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc and are widely available in the United States (and less available in certain parts of the world) and have limited side effects. If there is an increase in usage of these vaccinations, it could negatively impact the size of our addressable market.
The potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.
Even if we are able to commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate, the product candidate may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which could harm our business.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our ability to commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for such product candidate will be available from third party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels.
Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, may be difficult. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products, if they are approved, by third-party payors.
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. In addition, drug price transparency requirements may impact the marketing and sales of any approved products once commercialized. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical drugs. Third-party payors may also seek with respect to an approved product additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations or costly pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies before covering inarigivir, SB 11285 or any other product candidate. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement
will be available for any of these product candidates and, if it is available, whether the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of any of our product candidates, if approved. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285 or any other product candidate successfully, if approved.
There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.
We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.
The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive in our therapeutic areas of interest. We expect that we will face competition with respect to inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. For instance, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of chronic HBV. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
We expect inarigivir and SB 9225 to face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the relevant antiviral markets and advanced technologies become available. FDA-approved treatments for patients with chronic HBV include pegylated interferon-a, or PEG-IFN-a, products including Pegasys (PEG-IFN a-2a), marketed by Genentech, Inc., and PEG-Intron (PEG-IFN a-2b), marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, and oral antiviral agents such as the nucleoside analog Baraclude (entecavir), marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, and the nucleotide analogs Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Vemlidy (tenofovir alafenamide), both marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. These treatments are designed to decrease the risk of liver damage from chronic HBV by slowing down or stopping the virus from reproducing. In addition, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus Biopharma Corp., Arrowhead Research Corporation, or Arrowhead, Assembly Biosciences, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are developing therapies with varying mechanisms of action to address chronic HBV, including non-nucleotide antivirals and non-interferon immune enhancers.
There are a variety of available antiviral therapies and supportive care products for viral diseases. Some of these other drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, some are in clinical development and not yet approved, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of the approved drugs are well-established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. These factors may make it difficult for us to achieve market acceptance at desired levels and/or in a timely manner to ensure viability of our business.
We also expect our STING agonist program, including SB 11285, to face intense and increasing competition from companies in the immuno-oncology subsector of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Specifically, Merck and Aduro Biotech, Inc. recently disclosed early clinical trial results relating to their STING agonist programs. We are also aware of multiple small and large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc and BMS, that have STING agonist programs.
Many of our existing and potential future competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, have fewer or more tolerable side effects or are less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop. These appreciable advantages could reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity and render inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. For instance, in October 2018, Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced that it had entered into a worldwide license agreement with Arrowhead to develop and commercialize Arrowhead’s HBV candidate, a Phase 1/2 subcutaneous, ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapy candidate being investigated for the treatment of HBV. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidates.
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates by us or our investigators in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates if and after we obtain regulatory approval. Product liability claims may be brought against us by study subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, for example:
•
decreased demand for inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates;
•
the inability to commercialize these product candidates;
•
termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;
•
injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;
•
withdrawal of clinical trial subjects;
•
significant costs to defend the related litigation;
•
substantial monetary awards to clinical trial subjects or patients;
•
loss of revenue;
•
diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and
•
increased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the office of Health and Human Services, or HHS, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public.
Failure in our or our vendors’ information technology and storage systems, including data breaches subject to the new General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.
Our ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and storage systems. Our internal computer systems may be vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite the implementation of network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors’ servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Our systems may safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our subjects. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a
material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.
In addition, data security breaches, whether by employees or others, may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Effective May 25, 2018, the European Union implemented the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a broad data protection framework that expanded the scope of European Union data protection law to non-European Union entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of European Union subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR allows for the imposition of fines and/or corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of European Union subjects, including through a data security breach. Accordingly, data security breaches experienced by us, our collaborators or contractors could lead to significant fines, required corrective action, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, collaborators, clinical trial patients, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The GDPR imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States and provides an enforcement authority to impose large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. If we are unable to prevent such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events.
Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems, including data breaches, that could affect our technology systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce inarigivir and expect to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our other product candidates in the future. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of inarigivir or other product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster.
Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or their relationship with us is terminated, our business may be harmed and our drug development efforts could be delayed.
We rely on third-party research vendors, academic research institutions, CROs, and other third parties to conduct and provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, preclinical studies and clinical trials. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only some aspects of their activities. If these third
parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our service providers are required to comply with federal regulations and good clinical practice or GCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of subjects that are enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our service providers fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot guarantee that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
Our service providers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such service providers, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If service providers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize inarigivir, SB 9225, SB 11285 or any of our other product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
Because we have relied and continue to rely on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our service providers, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.
Our third-party vendors and service providers generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us under certain circumstances. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third-party vendor or service provider commences work, and the new third-party vendor or service provider may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party vendors or service providers terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third-party vendors or service providers or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.
We have no experience manufacturing any product candidate on a commercial scale and have no manufacturing facility. We are dependent on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of inarigivir, SB 11285 and SB 9225 as well as on third parties for our supply chain and expect to rely on contract manufacturers for any other product candidates. If we experience problems with any such contract manufacturers, the manufacturing of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate could be delayed.
We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved. Reliance on such third-party contractors entails risks, including:
•
delays by our third-party contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials, including but not limited to third-party contractors giving greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise not satisfactorily performing according to the terms of the agreements between us and them;
•
the possible termination or nonrenewal of agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;
•
the possible breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;
•
the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;
•
the possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;
•
the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and
•
the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a small number of third-party contract manufacturers to supply the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and required finished product for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These contract manufacturers are typically single source suppliers to us. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. If any of our existing manufacturers become unavailable to us for any reason, we may experience a delay in identifying or qualifying replacements.
For instance, in 2016, we had to transition the manufacture of the drug substance for inarigivir to another supplier. While we currently believe we will have sufficient drug substance to complete our Phase 2 clinical trials of inarigivir for chronic HBV, if the supply of drug substance turns out to be insufficient to complete such trials or we are unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all, our business may be adversely affected.
Each of our API and drug product manufacturers must comply with cGMPs and other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation, which occur in addition to our own quality assurance releases. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other regulatory requirements. We have little control over our manufacturers’ or partners’ compliance with these regulations and standards.
Any manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations, delay our clinical trials and, if any of our products are approved for sale, result in lost sales. Our manufacturers may experience problems with their respective manufacturing and distribution operations and processes, including for example, quality issues, such as product specification and stability failures, procedural deviations, improper equipment installation or operation, utility failures, contamination and natural disasters. In addition, the raw materials necessary to make API for our products are acquired from a limited number of sources. Any delay or disruption in the availability of these raw materials or a change in raw material suppliers could result in production disruptions, delays or higher costs with consequent adverse effects on us. Any reliance on suppliers may involve additional risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to future contract manufacture caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of our product candidates, increase our cost of goods sold or, if any of our products are approved for sale, result in lost sales.
If any of our product candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we plan to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production and distribution of those products. It may be difficult for us to reach agreement with a contract manufacturer on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. In addition, we may face competition for access to manufacturing facilities, as there are a limited number of contract manufacturers operating under cGMPs that are capable of manufacturing our product candidates. Consequently, we may not be able to reach agreement with third-party manufacturers on satisfactory terms, which could delay our commercialization efforts.
Third-party manufacturers are required to comply with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Facilities used by our third-party manufacturers must be approved by the FDA after we submit an NDA and before potential approval of the product candidate. Similar regulations apply to manufacturers of our product candidates for use or sale in foreign countries. We do not control the manufacturing process and are completely dependent on our third-party manufacturers for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture of our product candidates. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications or the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure the applicable approval for their manufacturing facilities. If these facilities are not approved for commercial manufacture, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could result in delays in obtaining approval for the applicable product candidate.
In addition, our manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements both prior to and following the receipt of marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Some of these inspections may be unannounced. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMPs or other regulatory requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines,
injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply and criminal prosecutions, any of which could adversely affect supplies of our product candidates and significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.
If we enter into additional licensing or collaboration agreements with third parties to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285 or any other product candidates, our prospects with respect to those product candidates will depend in significant part on the success of those collaborations.
We are a party to preclinical and clinical collaborations with third parties to evaluate the combination of our product candidates and the third party’s product candidate, including our ACHIEVE trial being conducted under our clinical trial supply and collaboration with Gilead. We expect to enter into additional collaborations with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in developing our product candidates, including inarigivir, SB 11285 and our other product candidates. Under such collaborations, we have or may have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators will dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will, in part, depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In addition, in the case of collaborations intended to evaluate the combination of inarigivir, SB 11285 and other product candidates, the success of any such collaboration may depend on the success of the development of the product or product candidate that our collaborator is developing. For instance, in the event that any of these third parties have unforeseen issues that negatively impact their clinical development or marketing approval for their products or product candidates or otherwise negatively affect their ability to continue to clinically develop or market their products or product candidates, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results and, ultimately, our ability to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates for the indications we are pursuing may also be negatively impacted.
Collaborations involving our product candidates pose a number of risks, including the following:
•
collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will devote to these collaborations;
•
collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;
•
collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;
•
collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;
•
a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;
•
disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;
•
collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;
•
collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and
•
collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.
Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If any future collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, it could decide to delay, diminish or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us.
Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure additional collaborative licensing or other arrangements that are necessary for us to further develop and commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the potential differentiation of our product candidate from competing product candidates, design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the regulatory pathway for any such approval, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the product to patients and the potential of competing products. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.
Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters
Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any future collaborators from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or our other product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which territories, we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or our other product candidates.
The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, promotion and distribution of products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We, and any future collaborators, are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States or in other countries until we, or they, receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable foreign regulatory authorities. Product candidates in various stages of development are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. We have not submitted an application for or received marketing approval for inarigivir, SB 11285 or any of our product candidates in the United States or in any other jurisdiction. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain marketing approvals, including FDA approval of an NDA.
The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and our other product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.
In addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment or promulgation of additional statutes, regulations or guidance or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. For example, on June 23, 2016, eligible members of the electorate in the United Kingdom decided by referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
Because a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the referendum could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to the approval of any of our product candidates in the United Kingdom. In addition, because the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is currently located in the United Kingdom but expected to move to the Netherlands as a result of Brexit, the implications for the regulatory review process in the European Union has not been fully clarified and could result in disruption to the EMA review process.
Reasons that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates, include:
•
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;
•
we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;
•
the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;
•
we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;
•
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;
•
the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;
•
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and
•
the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.
Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could negatively affect our ability or that of any future collaborators to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.
A Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.
We do not currently have Breakthrough Therapy Designation for any of our product candidates but may seek such designation. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation may be granted to a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for development. Drugs designated as Breakthrough Therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval.
Designation as a Breakthrough Therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe, after completing early clinical trials, that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to grant such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation by itself for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification.
A Fast Track Designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.
We do not currently have Fast Track Designation for any of our product candidates but may seek such designation. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether to grant this designation. Even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Many drugs that have received Fast Track Designation have failed to obtain drug approval.
Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidate from being marketed abroad. Any approval we are granted in the United States would not assure approval in foreign jurisdictions.
In order to market and sell our products in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, China and South Korea, we, and any future collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any future collaborators, may not obtain approvals from foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may file for marketing approvals but not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, Japan, China, South Korea or another foreign country or jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly diminished, and our business prospects could decline.
Any of our product candidates for which we, or any future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, or any future collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.
Any of our product candidates for which we, or any future collaborators, obtain marketing approval, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, among other things, will be subject to ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Thus, even if marketing approval of inarigivir or another product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.
The FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use and if we, or any future collaborators, do not market any of our product candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Similar post-market requirements may apply in foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek approval of our products. Violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.
In addition, the holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:
•
restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;
•
restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;
•
restrictions on product distribution or use;
•
requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;
•
warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;
•
withdrawal of the products from the market;
•
refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;
•
recall of products;
•
restrictions on coverage by third-party payors;
•
fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
•
suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
•
refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•
product seizure;
•
refusal to permit us to enter into government contracts; or
•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues.
We are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, curtailment or restricting of our operations, and diminished profits and future earnings.
Healthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, patients and third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable US federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
False Claims Laws. Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
HIPAA. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or for making any false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations on certain covered entities as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or
disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;
Privacy Regulations and the GDPR. Privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in many other jurisdictions where we may in the future conduct our operations. Regulators globally are imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in 2016, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the European Union as well as to those outside the European Union if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering goods or services to individuals in the European Union or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in.
Transparency Requirements. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to certain payments and other transfers of value, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;
FDCA. The federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices; and
Analogous State and Foreign Laws. Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement, curtailment or restricting of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations and diminish our profits and future earnings. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom will recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws,
as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA. Among the provisions of the PPACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:
•
an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
•
an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
•
a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•
expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•
a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•
extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•
expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
•
expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•
new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
•
a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•
a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•
a new Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and
•
establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2025, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the JOBS Act includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA. Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the PPACA would have on a pharmaceutical manufacturer remains unclear. We cannot predict the full impact of the PPACA or future reform measures on our operations. However, any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction
in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. The Budget Control Act of 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and a repeal or partial repeal and replacement of the PPACA may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.
Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any future collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.
We have international operations and conduct clinical trials outside of the United States. A number of risks associated with international operations could materially and adversely affect our business.
We have conducted clinical trials in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and certain Asian jurisdictions, and we anticipate that we will soon conduct clinical trials in additional jurisdictions, primarily in the European Union and Asia. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, including commercial, political, and financial risks. Emerging regions, such as Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as more developed markets, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Australia, provide clinical study opportunities for us. In addition, we are subject to potential disruption caused by military conflicts; potentially unstable governments or legal systems; civil or political upheaval or unrest; local labor policies and conditions; possible expropriation, nationalization, or confiscation of assets; problems with repatriation of foreign earnings; economic or trade sanctions; closure of markets to imports; anti-American sentiment; terrorism or other types of violence in or outside the United States; health pandemics; and a significant reduction in global travel. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these risks and other factors affecting U.S. companies with global operations. If our global clinical trials were to experience significant disruption due to these risks or for other reasons, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Beyond conducting our clinical trials outside of the U.S., we also expect to be subject to a number of risks related with our international operations, many of which may be beyond our control. These risks include:
•
different standards of care in various countries that could complicate the evaluation of our product candidates;
•
different U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;
•
different reimbursement systems and different competitive drugs indicated to treat the indication for which our product candidates are being developed;
•
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;
•
unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;
•
foreign currency fluctuations and compliance with foreign currency exchange rules, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and
•
business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including tariffs, war and terrorism, or natural disasters.
Laws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.
As we expand our operations outside of the United States, we will be required dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. For instance, the FCPA prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring maintenance of books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the company, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, the government operates hospitals, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for any environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.
We are exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, incentive programs and other business arrangements.
Misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government agency could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.
Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.
The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.
Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, most recently in December 2018, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown again occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
If we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.
We are a party to a license agreement with BioHEP Technologies Ltd. (formerly known as Micrologix Biotech, Inc.), or BioHEP, under which we license certain patents and know-how to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain product candidates, including inarigivir. We may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our license agreement with BioHEP imposes, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under the license agreement. Termination of these license agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.
Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business.
The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development, such as our employees, strategic partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our confidential information before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.
We may license patent rights that are valuable to our business from third parties, in which event we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or medicines underlying such licenses. We cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner
consistent with the best interests of our business. If any such licensor fails to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. In addition to the foregoing, the risks associated with patent rights that we license from third parties also apply to patent rights we own.
The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain. The steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue as patents. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. Changes in the patent laws, implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be adversely affected.
With respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our compounds will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or if any of our or our licensors’ issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.
Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our or our licensors’ patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and in some cases may not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.
If third parties initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.
Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and any other product candidates and to use our related proprietary technologies, without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, and interferences, post-grant review, inter partes review, and reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. As a result, we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any other product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform.
Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed
during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate.
If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the applicable product candidate. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing the applicable product candidate or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.
Defense of claims of infringement, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Parties making claims against us may also obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could materially harm our business.
Most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources and may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. The uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our research and development, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships.
Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
While inarigivir and SB 11285 are being observed in preclinical studies and/or clinical trials, we believe that the use of inarigivir and SB 11285 in these preclinical studies and/or clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. If these product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. We attempt to ensure that the methods we employ to manufacture inarigivir and SB 11285, as well as the methods for their use that we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties’ patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance they do not, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.
In addition, we plan to evaluate inarigivir and SB 11285 in combination with other product candidates and approved products that are covered by patents held by other companies or institutions. In the event that a labeling instruction is required in product packaging recommending that combination, we could be accused of, or held liable for, infringement of the third-party patents covering the product candidate or product recommended for administration with inarigivir or SB 11285. In such a case, we could be required to obtain a license from the other company or institution to use the required or desired package labeling, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and any other product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors’ intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors’ inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors’ inventions in or into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where enforcement is not
as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our or our licensor’s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors’ patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our and our licensors’ patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.
The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors’ patents, requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch generic versions of our products. Many countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors’ efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.
A number of foreign countries have stated that they are willing to issue compulsory licenses to patents held by innovator companies on approved drugs to allow the government or one or more third-party companies to sell the approved drug without the permission of the innovator patentee where the foreign government concludes it is in the public interest. India, for example, has used such a procedure to allow domestic companies to make and sell patented drugs without innovator approval. There is no guarantee that patents covering any of our drugs will not be subject to a compulsory license in a foreign country, or that we will have any influence over if or how such a compulsory license is granted. Further, Brazil allows its regulatory agency, ANVISA, to participate in deciding whether to grant a drug patent in Brazil, and patent grant decisions are made based on several factors, including whether the patent meets the requirements for a patent and whether such a patent is deemed in the country’s interest. In addition, several other countries have created laws that make it more difficult to enforce drug patents than patents on other kinds of technologies. Further, under the treaty on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, as interpreted by the Doha Declaration, countries in which drugs are manufactured are required to allow exportation of the drug to a developing country that lacks adequate manufacturing capability. Therefore, our drug markets in the United States or foreign countries may be affected by the influence of current public policy on patent issuance, enforcement or involuntary licensing in the healthcare area.
In November 2015, members of the World Trade Organization, or the WTO, which administers TRIPS, voted to extend the exemption against enforcing pharmaceutical drug patents in least developed countries until 2033. We currently have no patent applications filed in least developed countries, and our current intent is not to file in these countries in the future, at least in part due to this WTO pharmaceutical patent exemption.
The terms of our patents may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, such as inarigivir, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. For instance, certain patents for inarigivir begin to expire in December 2026, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.
Changes in patent law, including recent patent reform legislation, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.
As is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries involves technological and legal complexity, and is costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our and our licensors’ ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our and our licensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we and our licensors may obtain in the future. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our and our licensors’ patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors’ issued patents and those licensed to us.
In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a “first to file” system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. We may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize medicines without infringing third-party patent rights.
The USPTO continues to develop regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued opinions in patent cases in the last few years that many consider may weaken patent protection in the United States, either by narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances, holding that certain kinds of innovations are not patentable or generally otherwise making it easier to invalidate patents in court. Additionally, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.
Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.
Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information concerning our business strategy in order to protect our competitive position with respect to our technology and product candidates. Trade secrets are difficult
to protect, and it is possible that our trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and intentional or inadvertent disclosures.
We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, strategic partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and intentionally or inadvertently disclose or use our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.
Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets or the equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.
Our reliance on third parties and agreements with collaboration partners requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor may discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.
Our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture our product candidates is based upon agreements that limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets and know-how. Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and information are disclosed or used, even if unintentionally, in violation of these agreements. In the highly competitive markets in which our product candidates are expected to compete, protecting our trade secrets, including our strategies for addressing competing products, is imperative, and any unauthorized use or disclosure could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
In addition, certain of our collaboration partners are larger, more complex organizations than ours, and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of our proprietary information may be increased despite their internal procedures and contractual obligations in place with our collaboration partner. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, a competitor’s discovery of such trade secrets and information could impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.
We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property or in which third parties assert that our licensors, employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property. We may also be involved in lawsuits in which third parties assert their ownership of intellectual property that we regard as our intellectual property. These lawsuits could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful from our perspective and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.
As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, many of our employees, including our senior management, and our licensors’ employees, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party.
We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property rights. We may also have, in the future, ownership disputes arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. In addition, competitors or other third parties may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights.
Litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, or both. Our efforts in any litigation may fail and, even if our efforts in a litigation are successful, may result in substantial costs and require extensive attention from our management and other employees, which could harm our business and financial results.
Despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully defend ourselves in similar claims made against us. In any infringement proceeding, a court may decide that intellectual property owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights licensed to us do not cover the technology in question.
An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be further harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.
Because inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and any other product candidates we may develop are small molecules, after commercialization they will be subject to the patent litigation process of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which allows a generic company to submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the FDA to obtain approval to sell our drug using bioequivalence data only. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, since our candidates will be considered new chemical entities, we will have the opportunity to list all of our patents that cover our drug product or its method of use in the FDA’s compendium of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation,” sometimes referred to as the FDA’s Orange Book. A generic company can submit an ANDA to the FDA four years after our drug approval. The submission of the ANDA by a generic company is considered a technical act of patent infringement. The generic company can certify that it will wait until the natural expiration date of our listed patents to sell a generic version of our product or can certify that one or more of our listed patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. If the latter, we will have 45 days to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against the generic company. This will initiate a challenge to one or more of our Orange Book-listed patents based on arguments from the generic company that either our patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, if a lawsuit is brought, the FDA is prevented from issuing a final approval on the generic drug until the earlier of seven-and-a-half years from our drug approval or a final decision of a court holding that our asserted patent claims are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If we do not properly list our relevant patents in the Orange Book, timely file a lawsuit in response to a certification from a generic company under an ANDA or prevail in the resulting patent litigation, we can lose our proprietary market, which can rapidly become generic. Further, even if we do correctly list our relevant patents in the Orange Book, bring a lawsuit in a timely manner and prevail in that lawsuit, it may be at a very significant cost to us of attorneys’ fees and employee time and distraction over a long period. Further, it is common for more than one generic company to try to sell an innovator drug at the same time, so we may be faced with the cost and distraction of multiple lawsuits. We may also determine it is necessary to settle the lawsuit in a manner that allows the generic company to enter our market prior to the expiration of our patent or otherwise in a manner that adversely affects the strength, validity or enforceability of our patent.
A number of pharmaceutical companies have been the subject of intense review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, or a corresponding agency in another country based on how they have conducted or settled drug patent litigation, and certain reviews have led to an allegation of an antitrust violation, sometimes resulting in a fine or loss of rights. We cannot be sure that we would not also be subject to such a review or that the result of the review would be favorable to us, which could result in a fine or penalty.
The FTC has brought a number of lawsuits in federal court in the past few years to challenge Hatch- Waxman ANDA litigation settlements between innovator companies and generic companies as anti-competitive. The FTC has taken an aggressive position that anything of value is a payment, whether money is paid or not. Under their approach, if an innovator as part of a patent settlement agrees not to launch or delay launch of an authorized generic during the 180-day period granted to the first generic company to challenge an Orange Book- listed patent covering an innovator drug, or negotiates a delay in entry without payment, the FTC may consider it an unacceptable reverse payment. The biopharmaceutical industry argues that such agreements are rational business decisions to dismiss risk and are immune from antitrust attack if the terms of the settlement are within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a five-to-three decision in FTC v. Actavis, Inc., rejected both the biopharmaceutical industry’s and FTC’s arguments with regard to so-called reverse payments, and held that whether a “reverse payment” settlement involving the exchange of consideration for a delay in entry is subject to an anticompetitive analysis depends on five considerations: (a) the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition; (b) the justification of payment; (c) the patentee’s ability to bring about anticompetitive harm; (d) whether the size of the payment is a workable surrogate for the patent’s weakness; and (e) that antitrust liability for large unjustified payments does not prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuits, for example, by allowing the generic to enter the market before the patent expires without the patentee’s paying the generic. Furthermore, whether a reverse payment is justified depends upon its size, its scale in relation to the patentee’s anticipated future litigation costs, its independence from other services for which it might represent payment, as was the case in Actavis, and the lack of any other convincing justification. The Court held that reverse payment settlements can potentially violate antitrust laws and are subject to the standard antitrust rule-of-reason analysis, with the burden of proving that an agreement is unlawful on the FTC and leaving to lower courts the structuring of such rule of reason analysis. If we are faced with drug patent litigation, including Hatch-Waxman litigation
with a generic company, we could be faced with such an FTC challenge based on that activity, including how or whether we settle the case, and even if we strongly disagree with the FTC’s position, we could face a significant expense or penalty.
Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth
We will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.
As of February 28, 2019, we had 29 full-time employees, 16 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place are likely not adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:
•
managing our clinical trials effectively;
•
identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;
•
managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;
•
improving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and
•
expanding our facilities.
Our management may need to devote a disproportionate amount of its attention to managing these growth activities. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or identify, recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Our inability to manage the expansion of our operations effectively may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could also require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy, including the successful commercialization of our product candidates.
Our future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
We are highly dependent upon Martin Driscoll, our president and chief executive officer; Nezam Afdhal, MD, our chief medical officer; and Radhakrishnan P. Iyer, Ph.D., our chief scientific officer. We have entered into employment agreements with each of these executive officers. These employment agreements do not prevent such persons from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or other key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, replacing executive officers or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain marketing approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key employees on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions.
We rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with those entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates will be limited.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
The trading market in our common stock has been limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
Since our initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market on May 6, 2016, the trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The quotation of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect your ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock even if our business is doing well. Ultimately, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.
The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.
Our stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Because of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased your shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:
•
results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;
•
the success of competitive products or technologies;
•
developments related to any future collaborations;
•
regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;
•
development of new product candidates that may address our markets and may make our product candidates less attractive;
•
changes in physician, hospital or healthcare provider practices that may make our product candidates less useful;
•
announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;
•
developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;
•
the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
•
the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;
•
failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;
•
the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;
•
actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;
•
variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
•
changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;
•
market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;
•
general economic, industry and market conditions; and
•
the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.
Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates, if they choose to act together, may have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.
As of December 31, 2018, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned shares representing approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock, and this group, together with other stockholders holding beneficially 5% of more of our outstanding common stock, owned approximately 40% of our outstanding common stock. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, may be able to significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership control may:
•
delay, defer or prevent a change in control;
•
entrench our management and the board of directors; or
•
impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.
We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:
•
being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;
•
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;
•
not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
•
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and
•
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We have taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens. In particular, in connection with our recent offerings, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and we have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We expect to continue to take advantage of some or all of the reporting exemptions available to emerging growth companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
We incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.
As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the exchange or market upon which we trade and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.
We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies provide new guidance. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the exchange on which our common stock is listed. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
Our current controls and any new controls that we develop in the future may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we will be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If we were to have ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our preclinical studies or clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our Company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions include those establishing:
•
a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•
no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;
•
the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors;
•
the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
•
the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;
•
the required approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;
•
a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;
•
the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or stockholders holding a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and
•
advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Furthermore, our amended and restated bylaws specify that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums
and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.
Our ability to use our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
At December 31, 2018, we had potentially utilizable federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $86.3 million and $86.4 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards of $61.5 million expire between 2029 and 2037 and $24.8 million carryforward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2030 and 2038. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and may be limited due to restrictions imposed on utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards under federal and state laws upon a change in ownership.
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change,” is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the equity ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a three-year period (calculated on a rolling basis). We have made a preliminary determination that an ownership change likely occurred in each of April 2012 and December 2013. However, we anticipate that all of our approximately $86.3 million and $86.4 million of federal and state NOLs, respectively, will be available to us to offset future taxable income. We may have experienced other ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future, some of which are outside the Company’s control. These ownership changes may subject our existing net operating losses or credits to substantial limitations under Sections 382 and 383. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating losses or credits. Limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset U.S. federal taxable income could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.
Because U.S. federal net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 generally may be carried forward for up to 20 years, the annual limitation may effectively provide a cap on the cumulative amount of pre-ownership change losses, including certain recognized built-in losses that may be utilized. Such pre-ownership change losses in excess of the cap may be lost. In addition, if an ownership change were to occur, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses and certain recognized built-in losses could cause a net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and require U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. Further, if for financial reporting purposes the amount or value of these deferred tax assets is reduced, such reduction would have a negative impact on the book value of our common stock.
Net operating losses, if any, arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be subject to limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as discussed above, but will be subject to the further limitation, adopted by the JOBS Act, that in any year such NOL may offset no more than 80 percent of such year’s taxable income (computed without regard to any deduction for net operating loss carryover). As a result of limiting the deduction for post-2017 NOLs to no more than 80% of current year taxable income, we may be required to pay federal income tax in some future year notwithstanding that we have a net loss for all years in the aggregate.
Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.
We could be subject to securities class action litigation.
When the market price of a stock is volatile, holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. We may not be successful in defending ourselves or asserting
our rights in future lawsuits, investigations, or claims that may be brought against us and, as a result, our business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or claims may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a negative effect on our financial performance and business. Additionally, lawsuits, arbitrations and investigations can be expensive to defend, whether or not the lawsuit, arbitration or investigation has merit, and the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business

Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers using our proprietary small molecule nucleotide platform. We design our compounds to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states. We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir, for the treatment of HBV. We have designed our antiviral product candidates, including inarigivir, to selectively activate within infected hepatic cells the cellular protein, RIG-I, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that inarigivir, as a RIG-I agonist, could play an important role in antiviral therapy as a result of its dual mechanism of action that is designed to selectively modulate the body’s immune response and inhibit viral replication. We are also developing additional product candidates, including our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, which is an immunotherapeutic agent for the potential treatment of selected cancers.
Inarigivir Clinical Trial Strategy. We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir, an orally-administered hepatic-selective immunomodulator, as a potential backbone in a combinatorial treatment for chronic HBV with the goal to accelerate and substantially increase chronic HBV functional cure rates in a simple, safe and selective manner.
ACHIEVE Trial. We are currently evaluating inarigivir for the treatment of chronic HBV in a global Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial of inarigivir, which we refer to as the ACHIEVE trial. The ACHIEVE trial is being conducted under our first clinical trial supply and collaboration with Gilead. Approximately 80 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV have received doses of 25mg, 50mg, 100mg or 200mg of inarigivir or a placebo as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks, followed by all patients receiving a sequential dose of Viread® for 12 weeks. The active-placebo randomization schedule was 4:1 in the inarigivir monotherapy dosing period.
In the first three cohorts (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a 0.5 log10 or greater reduction in HBsAg. Of these 13 responder patients, six were HBeAg-negative (-) patients and seven were HBeAg-positive (+) patients. Additionally, we have observed a dose dependent response of inarigivir on HBV DNA and HBV RNA over the first three cohorts. To date, inarigivir has been well tolerated in the ACHIEVE trial, with no inarigivir-related serious adverse events observed, and no flu-like symptoms or other interferon-like side effects.
All patients in the final 200mg cohort of the ACHIEVE trial have completed dosing of Viread.
Gilead Collaboration. In July 2017, we entered into our second clinical trial collaboration agreement with Gilead under which Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial examining the co-administration of inarigivir and Vemlidy in patients infected with chronic HBV. This clinical trial collaboration was expanded in August 2018 to include two additional cohorts. In the first cohort of this Phase 2 trial, treatment-naive patients received 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 50mg and Vemlidy, while in the second cohort treatment-naive patients are receiving 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 200mg and Vemlidy. In a third cohort, Gilead is evaluating the administration of inarigivir 100mg in virally-suppressed patients who are already are and continue to be treated with a NUC. While we have approved the protocol for this trial under a joint steering committee, Gilead is conducting this trial at their own expense.
CATALYST Trials. We plan to initiate in the first half of 2019 two major Phase 2 global trials examining the administration of inarigivir 400mg in different patient populations and under different dosing regimens. We anticipate that the first global trial will be conducted in Asia and the U.S. and will evaluate non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve HBeAg positive and negative patients infected with chronic HBV who receive inarigivir 400mg as both(i) monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks, and (ii) in combination with Vemlidy for 24 weeks. We refer to this trial as the CATALYST 1 trial. Pre-defined responder patients at week 24 will continue to receive inarigivir 400mg and Vemlidy for up to an additional 24 weeks to determine if they are able to achieve a functional cure.
Concurrent with the CATALYST 1 trial, we plan to initiate a separate trial, which we refer to as the CATALYST 2 trial,
in the United Kingdom and Canada examining the use of inarigivir 400mg in non-cirrhotic, virally-suppressed patients currently on a NUC (i) following the cessation of treatment with a NUC, which we refer to as “Stop and Shock” treatment, and (ii) with the continued dosing of a NUC, which we refer to as “Suppress and Shock” treatment. Under the “Stop and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg for 24 weeks and then stop all treatment to evaluate for loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression over time, up to 18 months. Under the “Suppress and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg, in addition to their current NUC treatment, for a period of 24-48 weeks, and again stop all treatment with a follow up to see if there is either loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression off treatment. Pending preliminary results from the CATALYST studies, we plan to conduct a separate “Suppress and Shock” trial in the United States and the European Union, potentially in the second half of 2019. This trial could evaluate the efficacy of inarigivir 400mg over the course of 48 weeks in virally-suppressed patients when compared to the use of a NUC alone.
Fixed-Dose Combination (SB 9225). We are also pursuing the development of SB 9225, a co-formulation of inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, as a potential fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV. We have conducted early development work that indicates compatibility of inarigivir with Viread in the same formulation. We have conducted additional formulation development work for SB 9225 and successfully manufactured initial quantities of SB 9225. The introduction of SB 9225, if approved, could potentially result in enhanced patient compliance and allow for a more favorable safety profile. Subject to the results of our Phase 2 inarigivir trials, we could be in a position to initiate a Phase 3 program for SB 9225 in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2020.
Immuno-Oncology Program. We are developing our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, as a second-generation immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. In our preclinical studies in multiple tumor-derived cell lines, SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of cytokines consistent with engagement of the STING target, as well as cell death and apoptosis. Based on our preclinical studies performed to date, SB 11285 has reduced tumor volumes in multiple rodent tumor models when administered intravenously or intratumorally. These findings lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be administered clinically by either route of administration, and that SB 11285 may be used to target a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites and, if approved, has the potential to be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities to enhance efficacy.
We are currently advancing the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts. Subject to the results of these preclinical studies, we anticipate that we will submit an IND for SB 11285 in the second quarter of 2019, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in cancer later in 2019. SB 11285 could be the first intravenously-administered STING agonist product candidate to enter clinical development.
Financial Operations Overview
To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have not generated any revenue to date other than from grants from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and net operating losses for the next several years. Our net losses were $22.9 million and $27.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $102.1 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we continue to develop inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and our other product candidates. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Funding Requirements.” As a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, including our at-the-market offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never be able to do so.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $64.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2021. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Operating expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expense and general and administrative costs.
Research and development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, equipment, insurance and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
Our direct research and development expenses are not currently tracked on a program-by-program basis. Our primary focus has been on the research and development of inarigivir. Our direct research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants and CROs in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trial and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee-related costs and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because our primary focus has been on the research and development of inarigivir.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenues from inarigivir or any of our other product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medicines, including the uncertainties of:
•
establishing an appropriate safety profile with investigational new drug, or IND, application enabling toxicology studies;
•
successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•
launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•
if a product is approved, a continued acceptable safety profile of the product.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we initiate clinical trials for certain product candidates and pursue later stages of clinical development of other product candidates. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor and public relations costs.
Other income (expense)
Other income (expense) consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities consists of a gain or (loss) related to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with our private placement offering in November 2016, resulting from a change factors such as a change in our stock price and a change in expected stock price volatility.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described therein may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a predetermined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs in connection with performing research services on our behalf and clinical trials;
•
investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Warrants Issued in 2016 Private Placement
In connection with our private placement offering in November 2016, or the November private placement, we issued warrants to purchase 1,644,737 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the November 2016 Warrants. These warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $10.79 per share. We evaluated the terms of these warrants and concluded that they should be liability-classified. In November 2016, we recorded the fair value of these warrants of approximately $8.3 million. We recognize any change in the value of the warrant liability each reporting period in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of these warrants was approximately $8.5 million, which is a decrease of $4.6 million from the fair value of approximately $13.1 million as of December 31, 2017.
Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options. We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB) ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock awards, to be recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. We adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective July 1, 2018, which aligns the accounting treatment of nonemployee awards with employee awards. Described below is the methodology we have utilized in measuring stock-based compensation expense. Stock option, common stock and restricted stock values are determined based on a blend of our stock price and the quoted market price of our comparable public companies.
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, nonemployees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017. Prior to adoption, share-based compensation expense was recognized on a straight-line basis, net
of estimated forfeitures, such that expense was recognized only for share-based awards that are expected to vest. A forfeiture rate was estimated annually and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from initial estimates. Following adoption of ASU 2016-09, we no longer apply a forfeiture rate and instead will account for forfeitures as they occur.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the fair value of our common stock, the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because we lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information due in part to the limited time in which we have operated as a publicly traded company, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and nonemployees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
There were no stock options granted prior to 2015. We recognize forfeitures as they occur and the compensation expense for unvested awards is reversed in the period that the forfeiture occurs. The assumptions we used to determine the fair value of granted stock options in 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued common stock to directors as compensation for services and recognized expense equal to the fair value of the shares issued. The following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):
JOBS Act
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company,” or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.
As an EGC, we are relying on certain JOBS Act exemptions, including the exemption from the requirement that the auditors provide an attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earliest of the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of the closing of our initial public offering; the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase in preclinical studies and clinical trial-related activities for inarigivir and preclinical studies for SB 11285 of $5.1 million, salaries and benefits of $0.6 million associated with higher headcount in the year ended December 31, 2018, non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $0.4 million, laboratory supplies of $0.2 million, lease and building maintenance costs related costs of $0.2 million, consulting services of $0.1 million and non-cash charges for depreciation of $0.1 million.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase of $0.5 million was primarily due to an increase in non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $0.5 million, lease related costs of $0.3 million, loss on disposal of property and equipment of $0.1 million, all of which were offset by a decrease in other general and administrative costs including professional fees, investor relations costs, Delaware Franchise taxes and legal costs of $0.3 million and salaries and benefits of $0.1 million.
Other income. Other income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is solely comprised of interest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and was primarily related to the interest earned on marketable securities. The increase in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a higher average balance of marketable securities.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was a gain of $4.6 million and a loss of $6.8 million, respectively. The change in value each year was solely related to the change in the fair value of the warrants from the November 2016 Warrants, primarily as a result of the change in the Company’s stock price.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
From our inception through December 31, 2018, we financed our operations through proceeds received from private placements of convertible notes, common stock and/or warrants; the exercise of options and warrants; NIH grant funding; and public offerings. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $64.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $102.1 million.
In August 2018, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 3,246,079 shares of our common
stock at $12.50 per share, which included 246,079 shares pursuant to the exercise of an option to purchase additional shares granted to
the underwriters in connection with the offering. The shares issued in this offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to
our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-218399) that was declared effective by the SEC on June 12, 2017,
which we refer to as the S-3 Registration Statement, and a prospectus supplement and base prospectus filed on August 9, 2018. The
offering resulted in $38.0 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.
In August 2017, we entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Cantor, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. We will pay Cantor a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross
proceeds from each sale. Shares sold under the Sales Agreement will be offered and sold pursuant to our S-3 Registration Statement , and a prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 18, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold an aggregate of 217,329 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted average selling price of $15.42 per share, which resulted in $3.2 million of net proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold an aggregate of 252,443 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average selling price of $15.55 per share, which resulted in $3.7 million of net proceeds.
In June 2017, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 3,269,219 shares of our common stock at $13.00 per share, which included 384,604 shares pursuant to the exercise of an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering. The shares issued in this offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the S-3 Registration Statement. The offering resulted in $39.7 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented (in thousands):
Net cash used in operating activities. The use of cash in both periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. Net cash used in operating activities was $25.2 million and $17.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $7.5 million in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets of $1.3 million and an increase in other assets of $0.1 million, which was offset by a decrease in the net loss of $4.8 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $0.9 million. In addition, there was an increase in the non-cash change in the fair value of the warrant liability of $11.4 million, an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.9 million, an increase in non-cash investment income of $0.4 million and an increase in non-cash depreciation of $0.1 million.
Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of $34.9 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, offset by $58.0 million for the purchase of marketable securities and $2.0 million to purchase property and equipment. The cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of $22.3 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, offset by $34.4 million for the purchase of marketable securities and $0.3 million to purchase property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $43.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of $38.0 million of net proceeds received from the August 2018 public offering of common stock and $3.2 million of net proceeds from the Sales Agreement. The cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of $39.7 million of net proceeds received from the June 2017 public offering of common stock, $3.7 million of net proceeds from the Sales Agreement, $0.1 million for the exercise of warrants and $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options.
Funding Requirements
We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as our expenses increase, and we expect that our expenses will increase if and as we:
•
continue to develop and conduct clinical trials of our lead product candidate, inarigivir, including our ongoing Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial and our upcoming Phase 2 CATALYST clinical trials of inarigivir for chronic HBV;
•
continue preclinical development of SB 11285, our lead STING agonist product candidate, and initiate clinical trials of SB 11285, if supported by the preclinical data;
•
initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for our other product candidates, including SB 9225, a potential fixed-dose co-formulation product that combines inarigivir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any;
•
require the manufacture and supply of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire and retain additional personnel, including clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company; and
•
add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs.
We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2021. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials evaluating inarigivir and SB 9225;
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, if applicable, of SB 11285;
•
initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of any other product candidates we may develop;
•
our obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements;
•
the timing, receipt, and amount of milestone payments or royalties, if any, from inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 or any of our other product candidates;
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop;
•
the outcome, timing and cost of seeking regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those we currently expect;
•
the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;
•
subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of inarigivir and any other products;
•
the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;
•
the costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. As of December 31, 2018, we had up to $59.6 million in securities available for future issuance under the S-3 Registration Statement, which included $42.7 million in shares issuable pursuant to our at-the-market program and our Sales Agreement with Cantor. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
In addition to the amounts shown in the above table, we have contractual obligations pursuant to our amended and restated license agreement with BioHEP. Under this agreement, we have agreed to pay up to $3.5 million in development and regulatory milestone payments to BioHEP for each distinct viral indication for which we develop licensed product(s). BioHEP is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low-to-mid single-digits on net product sales of licensed products by us and our affiliates and sub licensees, and a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues we and our affiliates receive from sub licensees, which share of sublicensing revenues is capped at a maximum aggregate of $2.0 million under all such sublicenses. Milestone and royalty payments associated with our amended and restated license agreement with BioHEP have not been included in the above table of contractual obligations as we cannot reasonably estimate if or when they will occur. As of December 31, 2018, there have been no milestone or royalty payments made to BioHEP.
In October 2017, we entered into a lease agreement for our new principal office and laboratory space. The initial term of the lease is 125 months beginning on June 1, 2018, the date we began occupying the new premises. Following an 11-month rent abatement period, we will be obligated to make monthly rent payments in the amount of $34,699, which is subject to increase by approximately 3% annually for the first five years of the lease and by approximately 2.5% annually thereafter. The total lease payments due during the term of the lease are approximately $4.4 million and are included in the chart above. In addition, we are responsible under the lease for specified costs and charges, including certain operating expenses, utilities, taxes and insurance.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third party service providers for clinical trials, preclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. We have not included our payment obligations under these contracts in the table as these contracts generally provide for termination upon notice, and therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material and we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of if
and when they will occur. We could also enter into additional research, manufacturing, supplier and other agreements in the future, which may require up-front payments and even long-term commitments of cash.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. This standard removes inconsistencies and limitations between U.S. GAAP and IFRS in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and early application is not permitted. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, until we expect material revenue to be recognized, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments - Overall, and includes updates on certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. The new standard is effective for our annual period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, the adoption of this standard does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which amends ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and includes provisions intended to reduce diversity in practice and provides guidance on eight specific statements of cash flows classification issues. The new standard is effective for our annual period ending after December 15, 2017, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Leases will be classified as either operating or finance, and classification will be based on criteria similar to current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (“ASU 2018-10”), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements” (ASU 2018-11), which addresses implementation issues related to the new lease standard. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. Under this standard, disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements in assessing the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard permits two transition methods, (1) to apply the new lease requirements at the beginning of the earliest period presented, or (2) to apply the new lease requirements at the effective date. Under both transition methods there is a cumulative effect adjustment.
We adopted the standard on the effective date of January 1, 2019 by applying the new lease requirements at the effective date. We also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures and designing and implementing related processes and controls. We expect the standard to have an impact of approximately $3.0 million on our assets and $3.4 million on our liabilities for the recognition of right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities, which are primarily related to the lease of our corporate headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features and II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. Part I applies to entities that issue financial instruments
such as warrants, convertible debt or convertible preferred stock that contain down round features. Part II simply replaces the indefinite deferral for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests and mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities contained within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 with a scope exception and does not impact the accounting for these mandatorily redeemable instruments. This ASU is effective for public companies for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019; however, the adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and includes provisions intended to provide simplification of several aspects of accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions. The new standard is effective for us for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than the date on which we adopted Topic 606. We elected early adoption of this standard as of September 30, 2018. The adoption of this standard has resulted in a de minimis impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
Item 7A.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $64.4 million as of December 31, 2018, consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, because a significant amount of the marketable securities in our investment portfolio are short-term in nature , an immediate 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair market value of our investment portfolio or on our financial condition or results of operations.

The financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15.
Item 9.","Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Item 9A.","Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
As an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, RSM US LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has not audited or issued an attestation report with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of
Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Hopkinton, Massachusetts
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ RSM US LLP
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.

NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using a proprietary small molecule nucleotide platform. The Company is developing its most advanced product candidate, inarigivir soproxil (“inarigivir”), for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus. Since inception in 2002 and prior to its initial public offering (“IPO”) in May 2016, the Company built its technology platform and product candidate pipeline, supported by grants and through private financings. In September 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc., and in December 2016, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, SBP Securities Corporation.
The Company’s success is dependent upon its ability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize approved products, generate revenue, and, ultimately, attain profitable operations. The Company’s operations to date have been primarily limited to the development of inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and the Company’s other product candidates.
Basis of Presentation and Liquidity
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $102.1 million and $64.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
The Company expects to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. The Company anticipates that its expenses will increase significantly as it continues to develop inarigivir, SB 11285, SB 9225 and its other product candidates. The Company does not have any committed external source of funds. As a result, the Company will need additional financing to support its continuing operations. Adequate additional funds may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholders’ ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect common stockholder rights. If the Company raises additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc. and SBP Securities Corporation. Sperovie Biosciences, Inc. had operations consisting mainly of legal fees associates with intellectual property activities as of December 31, 2018. SBP Securities Corporation had assets primarily related to investments in marketable securities and operations consisting primarily of interest income as of December 31, 2018. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the accompanying financial statements related to the fair value of marketable securities, common stock and warrant liabilities, accounting for stock-based compensation, income taxes, useful lives of long-lived assets, and accounting for certain accruals. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are stated at fair value and include short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Included in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 are money market fund investments of $13.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, included in cash and cash equivalents are money market fund investments of $21.3 million, which are reported at fair value (Note 5).
Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2018, restricted cash consisted of approximately $234,000, which is held as a security deposit required in conjunction with the lease agreement entered into in October 2017. As of December 31, 2017, restricted cash consisted of approximately $484,000, of which $250,000 is held as collateral for the Company’s credit card program and $234,000 is held as a security deposit required in conjunction with a lease agreement entered into in October 2017.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Substantially all of the Company’s cash is held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high-credit quality. Deposits with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.
Investments in Marketable Securities
The Company invests excess cash balances in short-term and long-term marketable securities. The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based on facts and circumstances present at the time of purchase. At each balance sheet date presented, all investments in securities are classified as available-for-sale. The Company reports available-for-sale investments at fair value at each balance sheet date and includes any unrealized holding gains and losses (the adjustment to fair value) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is “other than temporary,” including the intention to sell and, if so, marks the investment to market through a charge to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives:
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset. Through December 31, 2018, no such impairment has occurred.
Deferred Rent
The Company’s operating leases include rent escalation payment terms and other incentives received from landlords. Deferred rent represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense over the term of the lease, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The Company had deferred aggregate rent of $249,000 and $35,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the Company’s research activities, including discovery efforts, and the development of product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on the Company’s behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture drug products for use in the Company’s preclinical and clinical trials;
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in the Company’s research and development functions;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. The Company recognizes external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to the Company by its vendors and its clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
Warrants
The Company reviews the terms of all warrants issued and classifies the warrants as a component of permanent equity if they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable, contingently exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its own shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the warrants must require physical settlement and may not provide any guarantee of value or return. Warrants that meet these criteria are initially recorded at their grant date fair value and are not subsequently remeasured. Warrants that do not meet this criteria are classified as liabilities and remeasured to their fair value at each reporting period.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for all stock-based payment awards granted to employees and nonemployees using a fair value method. The Company’s stock-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for employee awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the employees’ requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective July 1, 2018, which aligns the accounting treatment of nonemployee awards with employee awards. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the department to which the related services are provided.
Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consisted of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts payable and liability classified warrants. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of those financial instruments. The fair value of the marketable securities and liability classified warrants are remeasured to fair value each reporting period as described in Note 5.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a hierarchy of inputs used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 - Valuations that require inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities and warrant liabilities.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period, determined using the treasury-stock method and the as if-converted method, for convertible securities, if inclusion of these instruments is dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted net loss per share amounts were calculated based on the dilutive effect of the total number of shares of common stock related to the November 2016 Private Placement Warrants and the change in the fair value of the warrant liability. As of December 31, 2017, both methods are equivalent. Basic and diluted net loss per share is described further in Note 2.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions.
Guarantees and Indemnifications
As permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity.
The Company leases office and laboratory space in Hopkinton, Massachusetts and previously leased research and development space in Milford, Massachusetts under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company has standard indemnification arrangements under these leases that require it to indemnify the landlords against liability for injury, loss, accident, or damage from any claims, actions, proceedings, or costs resulting from certain acts, breaches, violations, or nonperformance under the Company’s lease.
Through December 31, 2018, the Company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no material claims were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.
Segment Information
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate and discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment and does not track expenses on a program-by-program basis.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. This standard removes inconsistencies and limitations between U.S. GAAP and IFRS in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and early application is not permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, until the Company expects material revenue to be recognized, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments - Overall, and includes updates on certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. The new standard is effective for the Company for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which amends ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and includes provisions intended to reduce diversity in practice and provides guidance on eight specific statements of cash flows classification issues. The new standard is effective for the Company for the annual period ending after December 15, 2017, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018; however, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Leases will be classified as either operating or finance, and classification will be based on criteria similar to current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (“ASU 2018-10”), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements” (ASU 2018-11), which addresses implementation issues related to the new lease standard. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. Under this standard, disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements in assessing the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard permits two transition methods, (1) to apply the new lease requirements at the beginning of the earliest period presented, or (2) to apply the new lease requirements at the effective date. Under both transition methods there is a cumulative effect adjustment.
The Company adopted the standard on the effective date of January 1, 2019 by applying the new lease requirements at the effective date. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allows the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company is currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures and designing and implementing related processes and controls. The Company expects the standard to have an impact of approximately $3.0 million on our assets and $3.4 million on our liabilities for the recognition of right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities, which are primarily related to the lease of our corporate headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features and II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. Part I applies to entities that issue financial instruments such as warrants, convertible debt or convertible preferred stock that contain down round features. Part II simply replaces the indefinite deferral for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests and mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities contained within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 with a scope exception and does not impact the accounting for these mandatorily redeemable instruments. This ASU is effective for public companies for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019; however, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and includes provisions intended to provide simplification of several aspects of accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions. The new standard is effective for the Company for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than the Company’s adoption date of Topic 606. The Company elected early adoption of this standard as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard has resulted in a de minimis impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

NET LOSS PER SHARE
The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of the Company for such periods (in thousands, except share and per share data):
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the diluted net loss per common share amounts under the treasury stock method was calculated based on the dilutive effect of the total number of shares of common stock related to the November 2016 Private Placement Warrants of 1,633,777 shares with an exercise price of $10.79. For the period ended December 31, 2018, the average stock price was $12.71, providing 246,802 dilutive shares for the November 2016 Private Placement Warrants. The change in the fair value of the warrant liability of $4.6 million is included in the net loss available to common shareholders for the diluted net loss per common share amount. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share.
The following potentially dilutive securities outstanding, prior to the use of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, because such securities had an antidilutive impact due to the losses reported:

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are performed in a manner to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Company classified its money market funds within Level 1 because their fair values are based on their quoted market prices. The Company classified its commercial paper and fixed income securities within Level 2 because their fair values are determined using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs.
A summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands):

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock
In June 2017, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 3,269,219 shares of its common stock at $13.00 per share, which included 384,604 shares pursuant to the exercise of an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering. The offering resulted in $39.7 million of net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.
In August 2017, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through Cantor, shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. The Company will pay Cantor a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold an aggregate of 217,329 shares of its common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average selling price of $15.42 per share, which resulted in $3.2 million of net proceeds to the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold an aggregate of 252,443 shares of its common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average selling price of $15.55 per share, which resulted in $3.7 million of net proceeds to the Company.
In August 2018, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 3,246,079 shares of our common stock at $12.50 per share, which included 246,079 shares pursuant to the exercise of an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering. The offering resulted in $38.0 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.
Warrants
In connection with the amendment and restatement of a license agreement with BioHEP in February 2016, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to BioHEP (the “BioHEP Warrant”). The BioHEP Warrant had an exercise price of $16.00 per share. The Company evaluated the terms of the warrant and concluded that it should be equity-classified. The fair value of the warrant, $0.8 million, was estimated on the issuance date using a Black-Scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions: an expected term of two and a half years, expected stock price volatility of 71%, a risk-free rate of 1.01%, and a dividend yield of 0%. The fair value was expensed as research and development costs. The warrant expired unexercised on August 1, 2018.
In connection with the Company’s IPO, the Company issued to the sole book-running manager for the IPO a warrant to purchase 27,600 shares of common stock in May 2016 and a warrant to purchase 747 shares of common stock in June 2016 (together, the “IPO Warrants”). The IPO Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $15.00 per share and expire on May 5, 2021. The Company evaluated the terms of the IPO Warrants and concluded that they should be equity-classified. The fair value of the May 2016 IPO Warrants was estimated on the applicable issuance dates using a Black Scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions: an expected term of 4.99 years; expected stock price volatility of 87%; a risk-free rate of 1.20%; and a dividend yield of 0%. The fair value of the June 2016 IPO Warrants was estimated on the applicable issuance dates using a Black Scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions: an expected term of 4.92 years; expected stock price volatility of 87%; a risk-free rate of 1.23%; and a dividend yield of 0%. The aggregate fair value of the IPO Warrants was $0.2 million.
In November 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with respect to the private placement of 1,644,737 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,644,737 shares of common stock (the “November 2016 Private Placement Warrants”) to a group of accredited investors. These investors paid $9.12 for each share of common stock and warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The November 2016 Private Placement Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $10.79 per share and expire on November 23, 2021. The Company evaluated the terms of these warrants and concluded that they are liability-classified. In November 2016, the Company recorded the fair value of these warrants of approximately $8.3 million using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company must recognize any change in the value of the warrant liability each reporting period in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the November 2016 Private Placement Warrants was approximately $8.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively (see Note 5).
A summary of the Black Scholes pricing model assumptions used to record the fair value of the warrants is as follows:
The following table summarizes the warrant activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:
2014 Stock Incentive Plan
In April 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and authorized 750,000 shares of common stock to be issued under the 2014 Plan. The Company’s 2014 Plan provides for the issuance of common stock, stock options and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors. The Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) became effective immediately prior to the closing of the Company’s IPO on May 11, 2016. Upon the effectiveness of the 2015 Plan, 116,863 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2014 Plan became available for grant under the 2015 Plan, and no further awards were available to be issued under the 2014 Plan.
2015 Stock Incentive Plan
The Board initially adopted the 2015 Plan in December 2015, subject to stockholder approval. The 2015 Plan become effective upon the closing of the Company’s IPO on May 11, 2016 after approval by the Company’s stockholders. The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of common stock, stock options and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company.
In June 2018, upon receipt of stockholder approval at the Company’s 2018 annual meeting, the 2015 Plan was amended and restated in its entirety increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by 800,000 shares (together with the 2014 Plan, the 2015 Plan, the “Stock Incentive Plans”). The Board approved the Amended and Restated 2015 Plan on March 9, 2018. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2015 Plan, there are 1,666,863 shares authorized for issuance. In addition, to the extent any outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, cancelled or forfeited after the closing of the Company’s IPO, those shares shall be added to the authorized shares under the Amended and Restated 2015 Plan. The total amount of shares authorized for issuance under both the 2014 Plan and the Amended and Restated 2015 Plan is 2,300,000. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 939,322 shares available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2015 Plan.
The exercise price of stock options cannot be less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options awarded under the Stock Incentive Plans expire 10 years after the grant date, unless the Board sets a shorter term.
The following table summarizes the option activity under the Stock Incentive Plans for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
As of December 31, 2018, all options outstanding have a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 7.6 years. The weighted-average fair value of all stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8.67. The intrinsic value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date of $10.39 per share and $13.44 per share, respectively.
In January 2018, the Company issued a stock option award as an inducement grant (“Inducement Award”) for the purchase of an aggregate of 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, outside of the Stock Incentive Plans, at an exercise price of $12.02 per share. The inducement grant is excluded from the option activity table above.
There were no stock options granted prior to 2015. The assumptions the Company used to determine the fair value of stock options granted in 2018 and 2017 are as follows, presented on a weighted-average basis:
The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
The fair value of stock options vested during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.3 million. At December 31, 2018, there was $3.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to stock options granted pursuant to the Plans, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years.
Reserved Shares
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company reserved the following shares of common stock for issuance of shares resulting from the exercise of outstanding warrants and options, as well as the issuance of shares available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plans:

INCOME TAXES
In general, the Company has not recorded a provision for federal or state income taxes as it has had cumulative net operating losses since inception
On December 22, 2017 the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “JOBS Act”) which reduced the US corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as well as a variety of other changes including the limitation of the tax deductibility of interest expense, acceleration of expensing of certain business assets and reductions in the amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction. ASC 740 requires us to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. The Company recalculated its deferred tax balances at the new 21% corporate tax rate and recorded an offset for the net amount as a component of income tax expense. This change was offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance because the Company maintains a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the JOBS Act, in effect allowing an entity to use a methodology similar to the measurement period in a business combination. Pursuant to the disclosure provisions of SAB 118, as of December 31, 2017 the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the JOBS Act on its existing deferred tax balances. The Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the JOBS Act as of December 31, 2018 and did not record any material adjustments to the original estimate.
A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. Federal Tax Rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:
The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands):
Because of the Company’s recurring losses since inception, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits of losses to date which result in deferred tax assets will not be realized and, accordingly, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $7.5 million in 2018 due to the increase in the deferred tax assets (primarily due to the net operating loss carryforwards). In comparison, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $8,000 in 2017 due to the increase in the deferred tax assets (primarily due to the net operating loss carryforwards) largely offset by a decrease from the deferred tax assets previously being valued at 34% and now being valued at 21%. At December 31, 2018, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $86.3 million and $86.4 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, if any. The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2029 and ending in 2037, with the exception of federal net operating losses created after tax years ending December 31, 2017. These net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite life and do not expire. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2029 and ending in 2038 At December 31, 2018, the Company had available federal and state income tax credits of approximately $294,000 and $449,000, respectively, which are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, through 2038.
Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on many factors, including the Company’s ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitations is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has completed several financings since its inception, which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future. The Company has performed a Section 382 study from its inception through December 31, 2017. The Company determined it experienced two ownership changes, but it expects to be able to utilize all its tax attributes despite the limitations calculated from the ownership changes. If ownership changes occur in the future, they could limit the amount of tax attributes available to offset tax due and increase the Company’s tax expense adversely. The Company will continue to monitor changes in its ownership and update its Section 382 study in the future for those changes before its tax attributes are utilized.
The Company has generated research and development tax credits but has not conducted a study to document its activities that qualify for research and development tax credits. This study may result in an adjustment to the Company’s research and development credit carryforwards; however, since the Company has not conducted a study any adjustment is unknown, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company’s research and development tax credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset established for the research and development tax credit carry-forwards and the valuation allowance.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and Massachusetts jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and state tax authorities is closed for tax years prior to 2015, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to tax year 2015 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdictions for any tax years. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits as part of tax expense. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits since its inception. The Company does not believe material uncertain tax positions have arisen to date.
During the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 that amends its guidance on certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. Companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock compensation in addition paid-in capital (APIC). Excess tax benefits occur when the amount deductible for an award of equity instruments on the employer’s tax return is more than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. Tax deficiencies occur when the amount deductible for an award of equity instruments on the employer’s tax return is less than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the interim period in which they occur. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and there was no impact to the income tax provision or footnote as a result of the adoption because the Company did not have any historical excess tax benefits.

Description of Business
Principal Products and Services
Pork Segment - Seaboard, through its subsidiary Seaboard Foods LLC, engages in the business of hog production and pork processing in the U.S. Seaboard’s Pork segment is a vertically integrated pork producer that primarily produces and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, distributors and grocery stores. This segment sells to U.S. customers and exports to Japan, Mexico, China and numerous other foreign markets. Pork products include fresh pork, such as loins, tenderloins and ribs which are primarily sold to distributors and grocery stores and fresh and frozen pork products sold in bulk to further processors who produce products, such as lunchmeat, ham, bacon and sausage.
This segment’s pork processing plant, located in Guymon, Oklahoma, generally operates at a double-shift processing capacity of approximately six million hogs annually. Seaboard also has a ham boning and processing plant in Mexico. In 2019, Seaboard raised approximately 88% of the hogs processed at its processing plant, with the remaining hog requirements purchased primarily under contracts from independent producers. Seaboard’s hog production facilities consist of genetic and commercial breeding, farrowing, nursery and finishing buildings located in the Central U.S. These facilities have capacity to produce approximately eight million hogs annually.
The Pork segment also produces biodiesel at facilities in Oklahoma and Missouri. Biodiesel is produced from pork fat supplied by the Oklahoma pork processing plant and from other animal fats and vegetable oils purchased from third parties. The biodiesel is sold to fuel blenders for distribution. In 2019, the Pork segment purchased and began modifying an idle ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas, that it plans to use to produce renewable diesel in the future. The Kansas plant is expected to produce 85 million gallons of renewable diesel annually when operating at full capacity.
Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Seaboard Triumph Foods, LLC (“STF”), which operates a pork processing plant located in Sioux City, Iowa. STF began single-shift operations in September 2017 and a second shift commenced in October 2018. STF’s plant is designed to process approximately six million market hogs annually when operating at full capacity. Seaboard has agreements with STF and Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”), an independent pork processor, to market substantially all pork products produced at STF’s and Triumph’s pork processing plants. Seaboard and Triumph supply a portion of the hogs processed at the STF plant. Seaboard’s revenues for its pork products are primarily based on a margin sharing arrangement that considers the average sales price, standard costs and the mix of products sold from the Seaboard and Triumph pork processing plants. The Pork segment also has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily’s Premium Meats, LLC (“Daily’s”).

Seasonal Business
The Turkey business is seasonal for whole birds and related products with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday demands driving the majority of those sales. Seaboard’s other segments are not seasonally dependent to any material extent.
Dependence on a Single Customer or Few Customers
Seaboard does not have sales to any one customer equal to 10% or more of consolidated revenues. The CT&M segment derived 11% and 12% of its sales from a former non-consolidated affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional equity interests were obtained in 2019 and as a result, this entity became consolidated in 2019. The Sugar and Alcohol segment derived 25%, 29% and 39% of its sales from one customer for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and another customer represented 23%, 19% and 10% of its sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Power segment sells power in the Dominican Republic on the spot market accessed primarily by three wholly government-owned distribution companies. The Turkey segment had one customer that represented 16%, 15% and 13% of its sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and another customer that represented 12%, 11% and 11% of its sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other segment has sales to a few customers that, if lost, would have a material adverse effect on any such segment or on Seaboard taken as a whole.
Competitive Conditions
Competition in Seaboard’s Pork segment comes from a variety of regional, national and international producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. According to the trade publications Successful Farming and Informa Economics, Seaboard was ranked number three in hog production (based on sows in production) and number four in pork processing in the U.S. in 2019 (based on daily processing capacity, including Triumph’s and STF’s capacity).
Seaboard’s commodity trading business faces competition from numerous traders around the world. Most of the grain processing and related businesses face competition from either imported products or other local producers in the same industries.
Seaboard’s Marine segment faces competition based on price, reliable sailing frequencies and customer service. Seaboard believes it is among the top five ranking ocean liner services for cargoes in the Caribbean and Central America based on cargo volume.
Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment owns one of the largest sugar mills in Argentina and faces significant competition for sugar sales in the local Argentine market. Sugar prices in Argentina can fluctuate compared to world markets due to Argentine government price controls and protection policies.
Seaboard’s Power segment sells the power it generates to the spot market or to contract customers at prices based on market conditions and cost-based rates.
Competition for the Turkey segment comes from a variety of regional and national producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. Butterball ranks as one of the nation’s top three turkey producers based on live production.
Environmental Compliance
Seaboard’s Pork segment and Turkey segment are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment that require the expenditure of funds in the ordinary course of business. Seaboard’s Pork segment and Turkey segment do not anticipate making expenditures for these purposes that, in the aggregate, would have a material effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Seaboard has identified important risks and uncertainties that could affect the results of operations, financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from Seaboard’s historical results of operations, financial condition or business, or those contemplated by forward-looking statements made herein or elsewhere, by, or on behalf of, Seaboard. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors described below.
(a)General
(1)Seaboard’s Operations Are Subject to the General Risks of the Food Industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:
●food spoilage;
●food contamination, including contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, pathogenic E coli and aflatoxin;
●food allergens;
●evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns;
●international, foreign, federal, state and local food processing regulations;
●consumer product liability claims;
●product recall;
●product tampering; and
●public perception of food production practices, including handling of production and live animals.
Pathogens which may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and therefore may be present in Seaboard’s products. These pathogens also can be introduced to its products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. Seaboard does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, Seaboard’s revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and Seaboard’s operating results could be adversely affected.
(2)International Operations Subject Seaboard to Risks That Could Have a Significant Impact on Seaboard’s Business. Seaboard is a diverse agribusiness and transportation company with global operations in several industries. Most of the sales and costs of Seaboard’s segments are significantly influenced by worldwide fluctuations in commodity prices or changes in foreign political and economic conditions. Accordingly, revenues, operating income and cash flows could fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, Seaboard’s international activities pose risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to U.S. markets. These risks include:
●changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
●foreign currency exchange controls;
●changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;
●hyperinflation;
●heightened customer credit and execution risk;
●tariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
●closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of meat products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;
●potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
●legal and regulatory structures and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and any lawsuits that may arise;
●negative perception within a foreign country of a U.S. company doing business in that foreign country;
●compliance with laws and regulations for conducting international business such as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;
●expropriation, civil unrest and government instability; and
●inconsistent application or enforcement of local laws, including tax laws.
(3)Deterioration of Economic Conditions Could Negatively Impact Seaboard’s Business. Seaboard’s business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, including LIBOR phase-out risks, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for Seaboard’s meat products, grains, shipping services and other products, or the cost and availability of needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting Seaboard’s financial results. The current national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:
●impair the financial condition of some of Seaboard’s customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by customers and suppliers;
●negatively impact global demand for protein and grain-based products, which could result in a reduction of revenues, operating income and cash flows;
●decrease the value of Seaboard’s investments in equity and debt securities, including pension plan assets, causing losses that would adversely impact Seaboard’s net earnings; and
●impair the financial viability of Seaboard’s insurers.
(4)Decentralization May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard’s operations are relatively decentralized in comparison with its peers. While Seaboard management believes this practice enables it to remain responsive to risks, opportunities and to customers’ needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that management may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that Seaboard may be slower to detect compliance related problems (e.g., a rogue employee undertaking activities that are prohibited by applicable law or Seaboard’s internal policies) and that “company-wide” business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect Seaboard’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
(5)Ocean Transportation Has Inherent Risks. Seaboard’s owned and chartered vessels along with related cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as:
●bad weather;
●mechanical failures;
●grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;
●human error; and
●war, piracy and terrorism.
Any of these hazards could result in death or injury to persons, loss of property, environmental damages, delays or rerouting. If one of Seaboard’s vessels were involved in an incident, the resulting negative public perception could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many aspects of the shipping industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard’s operations or detention of its vessels.
(6)Fluctuations in Fuel Costs Could Adversely Affect Operating Margins. Fuel expenses are a large expense for the Marine segment and impacts the CT&M segment’s results. Fuel prices can vary greatly from year to year. While such fluctuations may be offset through fuel surcharges or other mechanisms, such mechanisms do not act with precision in terms of timing and amount and may not adjust revenues enough to offset the increase in costs. The reduced global sulfur emissions cap from 3.5% to 0.5%, effective January 1, 2020, increased fuel costs or required equipment to clean emissions. Seaboard does not know the long-term effects of this new emissions requirement.
(7)Seaboard’s Common Stock Is Thinly Traded and Subject to Daily Price Fluctuations. The common stock of Seaboard is closely held and thinly traded on a daily basis on the NYSE American. Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are beneficially owned by Mr. Steven Bresky, President and Chief Executive Officer of Seaboard, and other members of the Bresky family, hold approximately 77% of Seaboard’s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the price of a share of common stock could fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than that of a share of more widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis.
(8)Seaboard Has Investments in Non-Consolidated Affiliates That Are Managed by Third Parties. Seaboard has several equity method investments in which it owns 50% or less, with various third-party business partners owning the remaining equity. Due to the ownership structure of these affiliates, Seaboard does not control all of the decision making processes and could be exposed to various business risks if the business partners’ business decisions do not align with Seaboard’s best interests, which could adversely impact the results for Seaboard’s income (loss) from affiliates.
(9)Seaboard Is Increasingly Dependent on Information Technology Systems to Manage and Support a Variety of Business Processes and Activities. Seaboard may be adversely impacted if it is unable to protect its information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or cybersecurity breaches. Attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Any significant penetration, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations and there is a risk of business interruption and reputational damage from the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and a risk of loss to financial assets related to manipulated electronic communications. This includes additional costs for increased security, system remediation and breach detection. If Seaboard is unable to prevent such breaches or failures, its operations could be disrupted or it could negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of its
common stock.
(b)Pork Segment
(1)Fluctuations in Commodity Pork Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for this segment’s products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for pork products and other proteins, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little to no control. Commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh pork and competing proteins on the market, especially beef and chicken. This segment’s results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in pork commodity prices.
(2)Increases in Costs of This Segment’s Feed Components and Third-Party Hog Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising hogs and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn and soybean meal. The results of this segment could be negatively affected by increased costs of its feed components. The continued operation of ethanol plants has elevated this risk as it has increased the competing demand for feed ingredients, primarily corn. Approximately 12% of this segment’s slaughtered hogs are purchased from third parties, and commodity price fluctuations for hogs could have an impact on this segment’s total costs. The cost and supply of feed components and the third-party hogs that this segment purchases are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which are driven by matters over which Seaboard has no control, including weather, current and projected worldwide grain stocks and prices, grain export prices and supports, and governmental agricultural policies. This segment attempts to manage certain of these risks through the use of financial instruments; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale pork prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of this segment’s feed components or in the cost of third-party hogs purchased would adversely affect Seaboard’s operating margins.
(3)Seaboard May Be Unable to Obtain and Retain Appropriate Personnel. The remote locations of the pork processing plant and live hog operations and a more restrictive national policy on immigration could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. This segment is dependent on having a sufficient number of properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to this segment’s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard’s operations.
(4)The Loss of This Segment’s Oklahoma Pork Processing Plant Could Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation of its Oklahoma pork processing plant. The loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action could adversely affect the business of this segment.
(5)Environmental Regulation and Related Litigation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. This segment’s operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, odors, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and any future changes to them could result in significant consequences to Seaboard, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Some requirements applicable to this segment may also be enforced by citizen groups. Seaboard has incurred, and will continue to incur, operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.
(6)Health Risk to Livestock Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and the Business. Seaboard is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the hogs and the reproductive performance of the sows could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to this segment’s pork processing operations and consumer confidence. If this segment’s hogs are affected by disease, Seaboard could be required to destroy infected livestock, which could adversely affect this segment’s production or ability to sell or export its products. Moreover, the herd health of third-party suppliers could adversely affect the supply and cost of hogs available for purchase. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of this segment’s food products.
(7)International Trade Barriers Could Adversely Affect This Segment’s Operations. This segment realizes revenues from international markets, particularly Japan, Mexico and China. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. These and other risks have resulted in, and in the future may result in, border closings or other international trade barriers that could have an adverse effect on Seaboard’s earnings.
(8)The Operating Profit of the Biodiesel Production Facilities Could Be Adversely Impacted by Various Factors. The profitability of this segment’s biodiesel plants could be adversely affected by various factors, including the market price of pork fat, other animal fats and vegetable oils, all of which are utilized to produce biodiesel, and the market price for biodiesel, which is influenced by world oil prices and U.S. government mandates and incentives to use biofuels. Unfavorable changes in these prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in U.S. government mandates
and incentives to use biofuels could adversely affect this segment’s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to these facilities. Also, the federal blender’s credits are not permanent and may not be renewed beyond 2022.
(9)Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Conversion of the New Renewable Diesel Production Facility. In February 2019, the Pork segment purchased an idle ethanol plant in Kansas. Projected costs to convert the existing plant’s infrastructure to support the new renewable diesel production facility and the costs to construct the new portions of the renewable diesel plant are variable and could be higher than initially projected by the time the plant is operational. Also, significant construction delays could delay the expected timing of operations.
(c)Commodity Trading and Milling Segment
(1)This Segment Is Subject to Risks Associated with Foreign Operations. This segment principally operates in Africa, South America and the Caribbean and, in most cases, in what are generally regarded to be lesser-developed countries. Many of these foreign operations are subject to risks of doing business in lesser-developed countries, which are subject to potential civil unrest and government instability, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, corruption, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls. In addition, foreign government policies and regulations could restrict the purchase of various agricultural commodities and commodity products, reducing or limiting this segment’s ability to access materials or to limit this segment’s sales prices for products sold in local markets.
(2)Fluctuations in Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect the Business of This Segment. This segment’s sales are significantly affected by fluctuating worldwide prices for various commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and, to a lesser degree, various other agricultural commodity products. These prices are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. European flour exports, donated food aid, flour dumping practices and worldwide and local crop production could contribute to these fluctuating market conditions and could have a significant impact on the trading and milling businesses’ sales, value of commodities held in inventory and operating income.
(3)This Segment Uses a Material Amount of Derivative Products to Manage Certain Market Risks. The commodity trading portion of this segment enters into various commodity derivative and foreign exchange derivative transactions to create what management believes is an economic hedge for commodity trades it executes or intends to execute with its customers. This portion of the segment also enters into speculative derivative transactions related to its market risks. Failure to execute or improper execution of a derivative position or a firmly committed sale or purchase contract or a speculative transaction that closes without the desired result or exposure to counter party risk could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and liquidity.
(4)This Segment Is Subject to Higher Than Normal Risks for Attracting and Retaining Key Personnel. In the commodity trading environment, loss of a key employee such as a commodity trader could have a negative impact resulting from the loss of revenues as personal customer relationships can be vital to obtaining and retaining business with various foreign customers. In the milling portion of this segment, employing and retaining qualified expatriate personnel are key elements to success given the difficult living conditions, the unique operating environments and the reliance on a relatively small number of executives to manage each individual location.
(5)This Segment Faces Increasing Competition. This segment is experiencing increasing competition in certain foreign markets by well-capitalized originators, traders of commodities making sales directly to end-use customers and industrial-asset owners that compete in the same markets as this segment. If various raw-material originators refuse to sell commodities to Seaboard for sale in these foreign markets, it could be more challenging for this segment to purchase commodities for sale to its customers at competitive prices. This segment’s sales volume and sale prices for commodities to customers, as well as results of operations, could be adversely impacted by such increased competition.
(d)Marine Segment
(1)The Demand for This Segment’s Services Are Affected by International Trade and Fluctuating Freight Rates. This segment provides cargo shipping services primarily from the U.S. to many different countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. In addition to the risks of overseas operations, fluctuations in economic conditions and unstable or hostile local political situations in the countries in which this segment operates could affect trade volumes and cargo freight rates, as well as adversely affect this segment’s results of operations.
(2)Chartered Ships Are Subject to Fluctuating Rates. Time-charter expenses are one of this segment’s largest expenses. Certain ships are under charters longer than one year while others are less than one year. These costs can vary greatly due to a number of factors including the worldwide supply and demand for shipping. It is not possible to determine in advance whether a charter contract for more or less than one year will be favorable to this segment’s business. Accordingly, entering into either long-term charter hire contracts during periods of decreasing charter hire costs or short-term charter hire contracts during periods of increasing charter hire costs could have an adverse effect on this segment’s results of operations. In an effort to improve cargo services on higher frequency routes and use more capacity, this segment purchases space, also known as slots, on certain third-party operated vessels. It is expected that this
segment will continue purchasing slots in the future, but these ship providers may not be reliable and cause shipment delays, damaged goods or other challenges.
(3)Hurricanes May Disrupt Operations. This segment’s port operations can be subject to disruption due to hurricanes, especially at this segment’s major ports in Miami, Florida and Houston, Texas, which could have an adverse effect on this segment’s results of operations.
(4)This Segment Is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations That May Adversely Affect the Revenues, Costs, Manner or Feasibility of Doing Business. Federal, state and local laws and domestic and international regulations governing worker health and safety, environmental protection, port and terminal security, and the operation of vessels, including fuel regulations, significantly affect this segment’s operations, including rate discussions and other related arrangements. Many aspects of the shipping industry, including rate agreements and vessel cost sharing agreements, are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission, the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as regulation by private industry organizations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard’s operations or detention of its vessels. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations and standards, including allowed freight rate discussions and other related arrangements, may result in additional costs or a reduction in revenues.
(e)Sugar and Alcohol Segment
(1)The Success of This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Argentine Economy, Currency and Political Climate. This segment operates a sugar mill, alcohol production and power generation facility in Argentina. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Argentine political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products, export opportunities and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. In this regard, local sales prices for bioethanol are affected by government price controls and domestic prices for sugar are affected by import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. If import duties are changed, this could have a negative impact on the sales prices of this segment’s products. In addition, the majority of this segment’s sales are within Argentina, and any Argentine government attempts to control inflation through retail price controls on mass consumption products, including sugar, could adversely impact the local sales prices of this segment’s products and the results of operations for this segment. In the second quarter of 2018, Argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy. A devaluation of the Argentine peso would have a negative impact on this segment’s financial position and results of operations.
(2)This Segment Is Subject to the Risks That Are Inherent in any Agricultural Business. Seaboard’s results of operations for this segment may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which Seaboard has little or no control and that are inherent in any agricultural business, including reductions in the market prices for this segment’s products, adverse weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and new government regulations regarding agriculture and the marketing of agricultural products. Of these risks, weather particularly could adversely affect the amount and quality of the sugarcane produced by this segment and its competitors located in other regions of Argentina.
(3)The Loss of This Segment’s Sole Processing Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single sugar mill. The loss of or damage to this mill for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes could adversely affect the business of this segment.
(4)Labor Relations Challenges Could Adversely Affect Operations. This segment is dependent on unionized labor at its single sugar mill in Argentina. The political and economic environment in Argentina makes normal labor relations very challenging. Contributing to the situation are the historical policies of Argentina’s government and the failure of the Argentine courts to enforce contractual obligations with unions and basic property rights. Interruptions in production as a result of labor unrest could adversely impact the quantity of sugarcane harvested and the amount of sugar, alcohol and power produced and could interfere with the distribution of products stored at the facility.
(5)The Operating Profit of the Alcohol Production Facility Could Be Adversely Impacted by Government Regulations. The profitability of this segment’s alcohol production facility could be adversely affected by Argentine government regulations regarding production quotas, fuel blends and sales prices in the bioethanol market. In addition, corn alcohol producers in Argentina have increased competition in the bioethanol market. Adverse changes in the Argentine government’s regulations regarding bioethanol production quotas and fuel blends could adversely affect this segment’s results of operations.
(6)The Operating Profit of the Cogeneration Power Plant Could Be Adversely Impacted by Contract for the Sale of Energy. The sale price for energy produced and sold by this segment’s cogeneration power plant is based on a biomass cogeneration contract with the Argentine government. The profitability of the cogeneration power plant could be adversely affected by this segment’s failure to enforce the terms of the contract, which could adversely affect this
segment’s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to this facility.
(f)Power Segment
(1)The Success of This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Dominican Republic Economy, Currency and Political Climate. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Dominican Republic political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products and the exchange rate of the Dominican peso to the U.S. dollar. In addition to significant currency fluctuations and the other risks of overseas operations, this segment could experience difficulty in obtaining timely collections of trade receivables from the government owned distribution companies or other companies that must also collect from the government in order to make payments on their accounts. Currently, the Dominican Republic does not allow a free market to enable prices to rise with demand, which could limit this segment’s profitability. The government has the ability to arbitrarily decide which power units will be able to operate, which can ultimately determine spot market prices for electricity generated and sold into the power grid and, therefore, could have adverse effects on results of operations.
(2)Supply of Natural Gas Is Limited in the Dominican Republic. Supply of natural gas in the Dominican Republic is limited to one primary supplier. Although the barge can run on other types of fuel, supply disruptions of natural gas could have a negative impact on this segment’s operating income.
(3)The Loss of This Segment’s Sole Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is dependent on the continued operation of a single facility. The loss of or damage to this facility for any reason, including fire, hurricane, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental actions or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes would adversely affect the business of this segment.
(4)Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Construction and Installation of the New Power Generating Barge. The new power generating barge is being constructed in Singapore, with delivery to the Dominican Republic expected in late 2020. Installation and commissioning are anticipated to take several months, with commercial operations expected in mid-2021. Significant operational delays, plans for the existing barge or other difficulties encountered in the start-up of operations could have adverse effects on results of operations.
(g)Turkey Segment
(1)Fluctuations in Commodity Turkey Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for turkey products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for turkey products and other proteins, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Butterball has little or no control. Butterball’s results of operations and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball could be adversely affected by fluctuations in turkey commodity prices.
(2)Increases in Costs of Butterball’s Feed Components and Turkey Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising turkeys and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn, soybean meal and other commodity grain inputs. Butterball’s results may be negatively affected by increased costs of the feed components. Butterball attempts to manage some of these risks through the use of financial instruments; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale turkey prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Butterball’s feed components would adversely affect Butterball’s results of operations and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball.
(3)Adverse Operating Results Could Result in Need for Additional Investment. Butterball has third-party bank loan facilities that are secured by substantially all of the assets of Butterball. Adverse operating results could cause Butterball to default on such loan facilities, which could result in a significant adverse impact on Butterball’s financial position or result in Seaboard needing to increase its investment or provide financing to Butterball.
(4)Decreased Perception of Value in the Butterball Brand and Changes in Consumer Preferences Could Adversely Affect Sales Quantity and Price of Butterball Products. Butterball is a premium brand name, built on a long history of offering a quality product that has been differentiated in the market. The value of the Butterball brand allows for sales of a higher unit price than other turkey products. In order to maintain this advantage, Butterball must continue to support the brand with successful marketing efforts and develop new products. Consumer product preferences continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer lifestyles; digital shopping patterns; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If Butterball’s products fail to meet consumer preferences, or Butterball fails to introduce new products or product extensions on a timely basis, the brand value could diminish significantly. In addition, negative news reports for any reason related to Butterball or the turkey/poultry industry could negatively impact this brand perception, Butterball’s results of operations and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball.
(5)The Loss of Butterball’s Primary Further Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Butterball’s Business. Although Butterball has four processing plants and two further processing plants, Butterball is disproportionately dependent on the continued operation of the processing plant in Mt. Olive, North Carolina, that handles a significant volume of the production of further processed turkey products. The loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including fire, hurricane, tornado or the occurrence of an adverse governmental action could adversely affect the results of operations for Butterball and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball.
(6)Health Risk to Poultry Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Butterball’s Business. Butterball is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases, such as avian influenza. The general health of the turkeys and reproductive performance could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to Butterball’s processing operations and consumer confidence. If Butterball’s turkeys are affected by disease, Butterball may be required to destroy infected birds, which could adversely affect Butterball’s production or ability to sell or export its products. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of Butterball products, resulting in an adverse effect on Butterball’s results of operations and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball.
(7)Butterball May Be Unable to Obtain and Retain Appropriate Personnel. The remote locations of some of Butterball’s processing plants and live turkey operations, along with a more restrictive national policy on immigration, could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. Butterball is dependent on having sufficient properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to Butterball’s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Butterball’s operations and the value of Seaboard’s investment in Butterball.

Item 2.","Item 2. Properties
Management believes that Seaboard’s present facilities are adequate and suitable for its current purposes. Seaboard’s principal properties by segment are described below:
(1) Pork - Seaboard’s Pork segment owns a pork processing plant in Guymon, Oklahoma. It has a double-shift capacity to process approximately six million hogs annually and generally operates at capacity with additional weekend shifts depending on market conditions. Seaboard’s hog production operations consist of the breeding and raising of approximately eight million hogs annually at facilities it primarily owns or at facilities owned and operated by third parties with whom it has grower contracts. This segment owns and operates seven centrally located feed mills, which have a combined capacity to produce approximately three million tons of formulated feed annually. These feed mills are used primarily to support Seaboard’s existing hog production and have the capability of supporting additional hog production in the future. These facilities are located in Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado. The Pork segment also operates a ham-boning and processing plant in Mexico that has the capacity to process 96 million pounds of ham annually. The Pork segment owns biodiesel plants in Oklahoma and Missouri, with the capacity to produce 46 million gallons and 30 million gallons, respectively, of biodiesel annually. In 2019, the Pork segment purchased and began modifying an idle ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas, that it plans to use to produce renewable diesel in the future. The Kansas plant is expected to produce 85 million gallons of renewable diesel annually when operating at full capacity.
(2) Commodity Trading and Milling - Seaboard’s CT&M grain-processing business, which includes 10 consolidated and 17 non-consolidated affiliates, operates facilities at 41 locations in 23 countries. Seaboard and its affiliates produce approximately six million metric tons of wheat flour, maize meal, manufactured feed and oilseed crush commodities per year in addition to other related grain-based products. The grain-processing and related agribusiness operations located in Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Peru, Republic of Congo, South Africa, Turkey, and Zambia own their facilities; and in Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Senegal and Zambia, the land on which certain facilities are located is leased under long-term agreements. Certain foreign milling operations may operate at less than full capacity due to low demand, poor consumer purchasing power, excess milling capacity in their competitive environment or imported flour. The commodity trading business has 13 offices in 12 countries, in addition to two non-consolidated affiliates in two other countries. Seaboard’s CT&M segment owns three 18,900 metric ton deadweight dry bulk vessels and charters between 30 and 59 bulk vessels with deadweights ranging from 5,000 to 64,000 metric tons under short-term agreements. Also, the CT&M segment charters four dry bulk vessels, each with a deadweight of 28,000 metric tons, which were originally purchased and then subsequently sold and leased-back.
(3) Marine - Seaboard’s Marine segment leases approximately 297,000 square feet of off-port warehouse space and approximately 86 acres of port terminal land and facilities in Miami, Florida, which are used in its containerized cargo
operations. Seaboard’s Marine segment also leases an approximately 62-acre cargo handling and terminal facility in Houston, Texas, which includes several on-dock warehouses totaling approximately 690,000 square feet for cargo storage. As of December 31, 2019, the Marine segment owned three ocean cargo vessels with deadweights ranging from 7,700 to 11,000 metric tons. In addition, this segment chartered 22 vessels under contracts ranging from less than one year to over two years with deadweights ranging from approximately 8,500 to 34,700 metric tons but has also entered into some contracts for longer-term charters that range up to 11 years. Seaboard’s Marine segment owns or leases dry, refrigerated and specialized containers and other related equipment.
(4) Sugar and Alcohol - Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment owns nearly 70,000 acres of planted sugarcane and a sugar mill with an annual capacity to crush approximately three million metric tons of sugar cane. The facility, including an alcohol distillery, has an annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 metric tons of sugar and approximately 33 million gallons of alcohol. This capacity is sufficient to process all of the cane harvested by this segment and additional quantities purchased from third-party farmers in the region. The sugarcane fields, processing mill, distillery and 51 megawatt cogeneration power plant are located in northern Argentina in the Salta Province. This area experiences seasonal rainfalls that may limit the harvest season, which then affects the duration of mill operations and quantities of sugar and alcohol produced.
(5) Power - Seaboard’s Power segment owns one power generating barge with capacity to generate approximately 108 megawatts of electricity that is secured on the Ozama River in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Seaboard’s Power segment is currently constructing a new floating power barge with capacity to generate approximately 146 megawatts of electricity using gaseous fuels, including natural gas.
(6) Turkey - Seaboard’s Turkey segment has a total of four processing plants, two further processing plants and numerous company and third-party live production facilities and feed milling operations, located in North Carolina, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas. These facilities produce over one billion pounds of turkey each year. Although capacity to meet core further processing demand is sufficient, Butterball uses third-party copack arrangements to supplement portions of its portfolio where it either does not maintain competencies, or to meet demand beyond its internal production capacity.

PART II
Item 5.","Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Seaboard’s common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol SEB. Seaboard had 2,308 stockholders of record of its common stock as of January 31, 2020.
Stock Performance Chart
The SEC requires a five-year comparison of stock performance for Seaboard with that of an appropriate broad equity market index and similar industry index. Since there is no single industry index to compare stock performance, the companies comprising the Dow Jones U.S. Food Products and Dow Jones U.S. Marine Transportation Industry indices (the “Peer Group”) were chosen as the second comparison.
The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return for Seaboard Corporation, the NYSE American Index and the companies comprising the Peer Group, weighted by market capitalization for the five fiscal years commencing December 31, 2014 and ending December 31, 2019.
The comparison of cumulative total returns presented in the above graph was plotted using the following index values and common stock price values:
In each of the four quarters of 2019, Seaboard declared and paid quarterly dividends of $2.25 per share of common stock. In each of the four quarters of 2018 and 2017, Seaboard declared and paid quarterly dividends of $1.50 per share of common stock. Seaboard’s Board of Directors intends that Seaboard will continue to pay quarterly dividends for the reasonably foreseeable future, with the amount of any dividends being dependent upon such factors as Seaboard’s financial condition, results of operations and current and anticipated cash needs, including capital requirements. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, Seaboard’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by debt agreements.
Seaboard has not established any equity compensation plans or individual agreements for its employees under which Seaboard common stock, or options, rights or warrants with respect to Seaboard common stock, may be granted.
As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard may repurchase up to $78 million of its common stock at market value from time to time in open market or privately negotiated purchases under its share repurchase program. There were no purchases made by or on behalf of Seaboard or any “affiliated purchaser” (as defined by applicable rules of the SEC) of shares of Seaboard’s common stock during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of share repurchase activity during 2019.
Item 6.","Item 6. Selected Financial Data
(a)Total assets increased $496 million with the adoption of the new leasing guidance. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(b)In 2019, net earnings attributable to Seaboard included other investment income of $225 million, which included $176 million of non-cash unrealized mark-to-market gains on short-term investments. Net earnings (loss) attributable to Seaboard for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included other investment income (losses) of $(152) million, $177 million and $69 million, respectively.
(c)In 2017, Seaboard recorded $65 million of additional income tax expense, or $55.31 per common share, as a result of the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). The additional income tax expense included a provisional $112 million of additional federal tax, payable over eight years, associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of permanently invested foreign profits, offset by an estimated reduction in deferred taxes resulting from the rate decrease from 35% to 21%. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2017 Tax Act.
(d)In the fourth quarter of 2015, Seaboard recorded interest income of $23 million, net of taxes ($31 million before taxes), or $19.49 per common share, for interest recognized on certain outstanding customer receivable balances in its Power segment. This interest income related to amounts determined to be collectible as of December 31, 2015, but previously had been considered uncollectable in prior years. This amount was fully collected by Seaboard in January 2016.
(e)In 2017, Seaboard resumed declaring quarterly dividends. In December 2012, Seaboard declared and paid a dividend of $12.00 per common share. The amount of the dividend represented a prepayment of the annual 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 dividends ($3.00 per common share per year). Basic and diluted earnings per common share are the same for all periods presented.
Item 7.","Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW
Sales and costs of Seaboard’s segments are significantly influenced by worldwide fluctuations in commodity prices and changes in foreign political and economic conditions. Accordingly, sales, operating income and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year. As each segment operates in a distinct industry and a different geographic location, management evaluates their operations separately. Seaboard’s reporting segments are based on information used by Seaboard’s Chief Executive Officer to determine allocation of resources and assess performance, in his capacity as chief operating decision maker.
Pork Segment
The Pork segment primarily produces hogs to process and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, distributors and grocery stores throughout the U.S. and to foreign markets. This segment also produces biodiesel from pork fats and other animal fat and vegetable oils for sale to third parties. Sales prices are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for pork products and other proteins. Feed accounts for the largest input cost in raising hogs and is materially affected by price changes for corn and soybean meal. Market prices for hogs purchased from third parties for processing at the plant also represent a major cost factor. Within the portfolio of Seaboard’s businesses, management believes profitability of the Pork segment is most susceptible to commodity price fluctuations. As a result, this segment’s operating income and cash flows can materially fluctuate from year to year, significantly affecting Seaboard’s consolidated operating income and cash flows. This segment is Seaboard’s most capital-intensive segment, representing approximately 53% of Seaboard’s total fixed assets, in addition to approximately 41% of total inventories. With the plant generally operating at capacity, Seaboard is continually looking for ways to enhance the plant’s operational efficiency, while also looking to increase margins by introducing new, higher value products.
CT&M Segment
The CT&M segment provides integrated agricultural commodity trading, processing and logistics services. The majority of the CT&M segment’s sales are derived from sourcing agricultural commodities from multiple origins which are delivered to third-party and affiliate customers in various international locations. The execution of these purchase and delivery transactions have long cycles of completion, which may extend for several months with a high degree of price volatility. As a result, these factors can significantly affect sales volumes, operating income, working capital and related cash flows from period to period. This segment represents approximately 52% of Seaboard’s total inventories. This segment owns three vessels, but the majority of the trading business is transacted with chartered ships. Consolidated and non-consolidated affiliates operate the grain processing business in foreign countries that are, in most cases, lesser developed. Foreign operations can be significantly impacted by changes in local crop production, political instability and local government policies, as well as fluctuations in economic and industry conditions and foreign currency exchange rates. This segment’s sales are also significantly affected by fluctuating prices of various commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal. Exports from various countries can exacerbate volatile market conditions that may have a significant impact on both the trading and milling businesses’ sales and operating income. Profit margins are sometimes protected by using commodity derivatives and other risk management practices. The CT&M segment has invested in several entities in recent years and continues to seek opportunities to expand its trading, milling and agro-processing businesses.
Marine Segment
The Marine segment provides cargo shipping services in the U.S., the Caribbean and Central and South America. Fluctuations in economic conditions and political instability in the regions or countries in which this segment operates may affect trade volumes and operating profits. In addition, cargo rates can fluctuate depending on regional supply and demand for shipping services. Since the Marine segment time-charters the majority of its ocean cargo vessels, it is affected by fluctuations in charter hire rates as well as fuel costs. This segment continues to explore ways to increase volumes on existing routes while seeking opportunities to broaden its route structure in the regions it serves.
Sugar and Alcohol Segment
The Sugar and Alcohol segment produces and processes sugar and alcohol in Argentina, primarily to be marketed locally. The Sugar and Alcohol segment’s sales and operating income are significantly affected by local and worldwide sugar and alcohol prices. Domestic sugar production levels in Argentina affect the local price. Global sugar price fluctuations, to a lesser extent, have an impact in Argentina as well. Historically, the functional currency of this segment was the Argentine peso, but during the third quarter of 2018 highly inflationary accounting was adopted and the U.S. dollar became the functional currency for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) purposes. See Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for discussion on highly inflationary accounting. The currency exchange rate can have an impact on reported U.S. dollar sales, operating income and cash flows.
Power Segment
The Power segment is an independent power producer in the Dominican Republic operating a power generating barge. Supply of power in the Dominican Republic is determined by a government body and is subject to fluctuations based on governmental budgetary constraints. While fuel is this segment’s largest cost component and is subject to price fluctuations, higher fuel costs generally have been passed on to customers.
Turkey Segment
The Turkey segment, accounted for using the equity method, produces turkeys to process and sells branded and non-branded turkey products. Sales prices are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for turkey products and other proteins. Feed accounts for the largest input cost in raising turkeys and is materially affected by price changes for corn and soybean meal. As a result, commodity price fluctuations can significantly affect the profitability and cash flows of Butterball.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion and additional total working capital of $602 million. Accordingly, management believes Seaboard’s combination of internally generated cash, liquidity, capital resources and borrowing capabilities will be adequate for its existing operations and any currently known potential plans for expansion of existing operations or business segments for the next twelve months.
As of December 31, 2019, $195 million of the $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments were held by Seaboard’s foreign subsidiaries. Historically, Seaboard has considered substantially all foreign profits as being permanently invested in its foreign operations, including all cash and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries. Seaboard intends to continue permanently reinvesting the majority of these funds outside the U.S. as current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund Seaboard’s U.S. operations. For any planned repatriation to the U.S., Seaboard would record applicable deferred taxes for state or foreign withholding taxes. See Note 14 for discussion of repatriation.
Summary of Sources and Uses of Cash
Cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 increased $29 million from December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of $171 million of net cash from operating activities, $132 million net proceeds from short-term investments, $42 million net proceeds from long-term debt and lines of credit and $24 million proceeds from sale of a non-consolidated affiliate. Partially offsetting the increase was cash used for capital expenditures of $349 million. Cash from operating activities decreased $67 million from 2018, primarily due to lower adjusted earnings for unrealized gains on short-term investments and significant cash outlays for inventories.
Capital Expenditures, Acquisitions and Other Investing Activities
During 2019, Seaboard invested $349 million in property, plant and equipment, of which $164 million was in the Pork segment, $23 million in the CT&M segment, $26 million in the Marine segment, $15 million in the Sugar and Alcohol segment and $121 million in the Power segment. The Pork segment expenditures were primarily for the expansion of the Oklahoma pork processing plant and the purchase and modifications of an idle ethanol plant and its related assets in Hugoton, Kansas. The CT&M segment expenditures were primarily for milling assets. The Sugar and Alcohol expenditures were primarily for alcohol fermentation expansion. The Power segment expenditures were primarily for its power generating barge under construction. All other capital expenditures were primarily of a normal recurring nature such as replacements of machinery and equipment and general facility modernizations and upgrades.
The total budget for 2020 capital expenditures is $313 million. The Pork segment budgeted $215 million primarily for the expansion of the pork processing plant that is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020 and the modifications to convert the Hugoton, Kansas plant to a renewable diesel production facility, with operations expected to begin in 2022. The estimated cost of the conversion is expected to be between approximately $220 million and $270 million, depending upon finalization of construction contracts. The CT&M segment budgeted $25 million primarily for milling assets, including a new mixing plant, and other improvements to existing facilities and related equipment. The Marine segment budgeted $37 million primarily for additional cargo carrying and handling equipment. The Sugar and Alcohol segment budgeted $14 million primarily for general plant improvements and production process updates. The Power segment budgeted $22 million for further capital expenditures associated with the new power barge. Seaboard’s Power segment continues to explore strategic alternatives for the existing barge, including selling, relocating or operating in conjunction with the new barge at the current site. The estimated total cost of the project is expected to be between approximately $185 million to $210 million, depending upon the alternative selected. Management anticipates paying for these capital
expenditures from a combination of available cash, the use of available short-term investments and Seaboard’s available borrowing capacity.
Seaboard has acquired businesses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and intends to continue to look for opportunities to further grow and diversify its operations. Also, from time to time, Seaboard may fund capital calls and borrowings for its equity method investments based on the specific facts and circumstances. During 2019, Seaboard contributed $20 million to STF, a non-consolidated affiliate of the Pork segment, for working capital needs.
Financing Activities
The following table presents a summary of Seaboard’s available borrowing capacity:
Seaboard has long-term debt of $793 million, which includes a term loan of $691 million and foreign subsidiary obligations of $102 million. Seaboard has capacity under existing Term Loan Credit Agreement debt covenants to undertake additional debt financings of approximately $1,326 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lines of credit and long-term debt.
Management intends to continue seeking opportunities for expansion in the industries in which Seaboard operates, utilizing existing liquidity, available borrowing capacity and other financing alternatives. The terms and availability of such financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions, as well as Seaboard's financial condition and results of operations at the time Seaboard seeks such financing, and there can be no assurances that Seaboard will be able to obtain such financing on terms that will be acceptable or advantageous.
Seaboard’s Board of Directors intends that Seaboard will continue to pay quarterly dividends for the reasonably foreseeable future, with the amount of any dividends being dependent upon such factors as Seaboard’s financial condition, results of operations and current and anticipated cash needs, including capital requirements. Also, Seaboard may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Several of Seaboard’s segments have long-term contractual obligations, including purchase commitments and non-cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 9 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on purchase commitments and leases, respectively.
The following table provides a summary of Seaboard’s long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:
(a)  Interest payments in the table above include expected cash payments for interest on variable and fixed rate long-term debt. Variable interest rates are based on interest rates as of December 31, 2019.
(b)  Retirement benefit payments in the table above represent expected benefit payments for various non-qualified pension plans and supplemental retirement arrangements as discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements, which are unfunded obligations that are deemed to be employer contributions. No contributions are planned at this time to the qualified pension plan.
(c)  U.S. federal income tax on mandatory deemed repatriation pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act.
Deferred income taxes and certain other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets are not included in the table above as management is unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments for these items.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $6.8 billion, $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The increase for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected higher volumes of certain commodities in the CT&M segment and higher prices for pork products sold in the Pork segment, partially offset by lower biodiesel revenue in the Pork segment and lower volumes and prices of sugar and alcohol sold in the Sugar and Alcohol segment. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflected higher volumes and sales prices for certain commodities in the CT&M segment, higher biodiesel revenue and higher volumes of market hogs and pork products sold in the Pork segment and higher cargo volumes and rates in the Marine segment.
Operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $104 million, $209 million and $240 million, respectively. The decrease for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected derivative contract losses and lower margins on biodiesel sales in the Pork segment, lower alcohol margins in the Sugar and Alcohol segment and higher voyage costs in the Marine segment. The decrease for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflected lower prices on pork products sold and higher feed costs in the Pork segment, partially offset by higher margins from biodiesel sales in the Pork segment, higher margins on third-party sales in the CT&M segment and higher spot market rates in the Power segment.
Pork Segment
Net sales for the Pork segment increased $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily the result of higher volumes and prices of market hogs sold, higher prices and volumes for pork products sold and the recognition of the federal blender’s credits of $60 million in December 2019 for biodiesel production in tax years 2018 and 2019, partially offset by lower biodiesel prices and volumes. In the first quarter of 2018, the Pork segment received $42 million of revenue related to 2017 biodiesel production.
Operating income for the Pork segment decreased $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to derivative contract losses, lower margins on biodiesel sales and a $14 million expense related to the withdrawal liability from a multi-employer pension fund as discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by higher margins on pork product sales and the increase in federal blender’s credits received. Margins on pork product sales increased as higher sales prices were only partially offset by higher production and processing costs. Seaboard sells pork to international customers located in China, among other countries, and incremental tariffs, the duration of which is uncertain, continue to have a negative impact on earnings. Management is unable to predict future market prices for pork products, the cost of feed or third-party hogs; however, management anticipates positive operating income for this segment in 2020.
Loss from affiliates decreased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the commencement of a second shift in October 2018 at the STF plant.
Net sales for the Pork segment increased $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher overall increased volumes of pork products sold, increased volumes and prices of biodiesel sales, the recognition of the federal blender’s credits of $42 million and higher sales of market hogs to third parties and affiliates. The increase was partially offset by lower prices for both pork products and market hogs sold.
Operating income for the Pork segment decreased $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of lower prices for pork products along with higher feed costs, partially offset by higher volumes of pork products sold and the federal blender’s credits of $42 million.
Loss from affiliates increased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the start-up of STF operations, which began in September 2017.
Commodity Trading and Milling Segment
Net sales for the CT&M segment increased $244 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase primarily reflected higher volumes of certain commodities for third-party customers, including sales for a business acquired in January 2018 with certain entities on a three-month lag and another business acquired in October 2019, and higher wheat, corn and other commodity prices, partially offset by lower affiliate volumes and sales prices.
Operating income for the CT&M segment increased $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase primarily reflected higher margins on third-party sales, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs related to the business acquired. Due to worldwide commodity price fluctuations, the uncertain political and economic conditions in the countries in which this segment operates, and the volatility in the commodity markets, management is unable to predict future sales and operating results for this segment. However, management anticipates positive operating income for this segment in 2020, excluding the effects of marking to market derivative contracts.
Had Seaboard not applied mark-to-market accounting to its derivative instruments, operating income for this segment would have been higher by $5 and $3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and lower by $4 million in 2017. While management believes its commodity futures, options and foreign exchange contracts are primarily economic hedges of its firm purchase and sales contracts or anticipated sales contracts, Seaboard does not perform the extensive record-keeping required to account for these transactions as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, while the changes in value of the derivative instruments were marked to market, the changes in value of the firm purchase or sales contracts were not. As products are delivered to customers, these existing mark-to-market adjustments should be primarily offset by realized margins or losses as revenue is recognized over time and therefore, these mark-to-market adjustments could reverse in fiscal 2020. Management believes eliminating these mark-to-market adjustments provides a more reasonable presentation to compare and evaluate period-to-period financial results for this segment.
Loss from affiliates for the CT&M segment decreased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Based on the uncertainty of local political and economic environments in the countries in which Seaboard’s affiliates operate, management cannot predict future results.
Net sales for the CT&M segment increased $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflected higher volumes of third-party sales, including sales for a business acquired in January 2018, and higher affiliate sales prices, partially offset by lower third-party sales prices.
Operating income for the CT&M segment increased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflected higher margins on third-party sales, predominantly related to the business acquired, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs related to the business acquired. Excluding the effects of the mark-to-market adjustments for derivative contracts, operating income increased $28 million.
Income from affiliates for the CT&M segment decreased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease primarily reflected price and volume volatility in local markets of certain Seaboard affiliates, including losses at an equity method investment located in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Marine Segment
Net sales for the Marine segment increased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a change in cargo mix, with more reefer containers that generally have a higher rate, partially offset by lower cargo volumes.
Operating income for the Marine segment decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of higher voyage costs related to charter hire rates, terminal costs and fuel costs. The reduced global sulfur emissions cap from 3.5% to 0.5% became effective on January 1, 2020 and resulted in higher fuel costs as purchases of low-sulfur fuel began in late 2019. Management cannot predict changes in future cargo volumes, cargo rates and fuel costs or to what extent changes in economic conditions in markets served will affect net sales or operating income. Based on market conditions, management currently cannot predict if this segment will be profitable in 2020.
Net sales for the Marine segment increased $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher volumes and rates in certain markets during 2018 compared to 2017.
Operating income for the Marine segment increased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher revenues, partially offset by higher voyage costs related to fuel price increases and other expenses.
Income from affiliates increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $6 million incurred in 2017.
Sugar and Alcohol Segment
Net sales for the Sugar and Alcohol segment decreased $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease primarily reflected lower volumes and prices of sugar and alcohol sold. Sugar and alcohol sales are denominated in Argentine pesos, and an increase in local sales prices was offset by exchange rate changes as the Argentine peso continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Management cannot predict local sugar and alcohol prices or the volatility in the currency exchange rate. Argentina was determined by management to be a highly inflationary economy in the second quarter of 2018, and as a result, this segment’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar effective in the third quarter of 2018 until the economic environment stabilizes.
Operating income for the Sugar and Alcohol decreased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease primarily reflected lower margins on alcohol, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Based on market conditions, management cannot predict if this segment will be profitable in 2020.
Net sales for the Sugar and Alcohol segment decreased $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease primarily reflected lower prices of sugar and alcohol sold, partially offset by higher volumes of sugar and alcohol sold.
Operating income for the Sugar and Alcohol segment decreased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease primarily reflected lower margins on sugar, alcohol and cogeneration, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses related to salaries and benefits.
Power Segment
Net sales for the Power segment decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease primarily reflected lower spot market rates as a result of lower fuel prices.
Operating income for the Power segment increased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower fuel costs, partially offset by lower revenues. Management cannot predict future fuel costs or the extent that spot market rates will fluctuate compared to fuel costs; however, management anticipates positive operating income for this segment in 2020.
Net sales for the Power segment increased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflected higher spot market rates.
Operating income for the Power segment increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher spot market rates, partially offset by higher fuel costs.
Turkey Segment
The Turkey segment, accounted for using the equity method, represents Seaboard’s investment in Butterball. The increase in loss from affiliate for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher production and other costs, including interest, partially offset by higher prices for turkey products sold. Management is unable to predict future market prices for turkey products or the cost of feed. Based on market conditions, management currently cannot predict if this segment will be profitable in 2020.
The increase in income from affiliate for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher logistics and production costs and lower volumes of turkey products sold in 2018, partially offset by Seaboard’s proportionate share of the Illinois plant closure during 2017. Butterball closed a further processing plant located in Illinois and recognized fixed asset impairment charges and accrued severance. Seaboard’s proportionate share of these charges, recognized in income (loss) from affiliates, was $18 million, all recorded in 2017.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $22 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased personnel-related costs, including higher costs related to Seaboard’s deferred compensation program and the businesses acquired. The deferred compensation program costs are offset by the effect of the mark-to-market on investments recorded in other investment income (loss). SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $5 million compared to 2017. The increase was primarily the result of increased personnel-related costs in the CT&M segment, related to the business acquired in January 2018, partially offset by lower costs related to Seaboard’s deferred compensation program. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A was 5% for 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $36 million, $44 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to lower interest rates on outstanding debt for the Sugar and Alcohol segment and more capitalized interest related to capital expenditure investments, partially offset by higher debt outstanding related to the Term Loan due 2028 amended in September 2018. The increase in interest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily related to more debt outstanding, an increase in interest rates and less capitalized interest.
Interest Income
Interest income totaled $28 million, $11 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased investments in debt securities.
Interest Income from Affiliates
Interest income from affiliates totaled $2 million, $3 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease for 2018 compared 2017 primarily related to the Butterball note receivable, which was repaid in December 2017.
Other Investment Income (Loss), Net
Other investment income (loss), net totaled $225 million, $(152) million and $177 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes primarily reflect mark-to-market fluctuations on short-term investments.
Foreign Currency Gains, Net
Foreign currency gains, net totaled $0 million, $4 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in foreign currency gains for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected losses in the Argentine peso, partially offset by fluctuations of other currency exchange rates in several foreign countries. The decrease in foreign currency gains for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflected losses in the euro and British pound on Seaboard’s short-term investments and the Zambian kwacha, partially offset by gains in the Argentine peso, among fluctuations of other currency exchange rates in several foreign countries. The Sugar and Alcohol segment’s functional currency became the U.S. dollar in mid-2018 due to highly inflationary accounting and any translation gains or losses are recorded in the income statement rather than other comprehensive income.
Income Tax Expense
The 2019 effective tax rate was lower than the 2018 effective tax rate primarily due to increased federal investment tax credits and more tax-exempt income from the retroactive extension of the federal blender’s credits in December 2019 for both 2018 and 2019. Also, the 2018 rate was impacted by the change in tax classification of a wholly owned subsidiary from a partnership to a corporation and an adjustment to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) income tax liability. The 2018 effective tax rate was lower than 2017 primarily due to a current year loss versus prior year earnings, tax exempt income from the retroactive extension of the 2017 federal blender’s credits during the first quarter of 2018 and the lower statutory U.S. federal income tax rate per the 2017 Tax Act. The decrease was partially offset by a tax classification entity change, additional tax related to the 2017 Tax Act and a change in mix of domestic and foreign earnings from the prior year. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Seaboard’s income taxes.
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon Seaboard’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Seaboard to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Management has identified the accounting estimates believed to be the most important to the portrayal of Seaboard’s financial condition and results, and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Seaboard primarily uses a specific identification approach to evaluate the adequacy of this reserve for estimated uncollectible receivables at the consolidated balance sheet date. Changes in estimates, developing trends and other new information can have a material effect on future evaluations. Furthermore, Seaboard’s total gross current receivables are weighted toward foreign receivables ($390 million or 59% as of December 31, 2019), including foreign receivables due from affiliates ($81 million as of December 31, 2019), which generally represent more of a collection risk than its domestic receivables. Receivables due from affiliates are generally associated with entities located in foreign countries considered less developed than the U.S. that can experience conditions causing sudden changes to their ability to pay such receivables on a timely basis or in full. Based on various historical experiences, future collections of receivables or lack thereof could result in a material charge or credit to earnings depending on the ultimate resolution of each individual customer past due receivable. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $5 million, $7 million and $12 million, respectively.
Valuation of Inventories - Inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. In determining net realizable value, management makes assumptions regarding estimated sales prices, estimated costs to complete and estimated disposal costs. For commodity trading inventories, when contract performance by a customer becomes a
concern, management must also evaluate available options to dispose of the inventory, including assumptions about potential negotiated changes to sales contracts, sales prices in alternative markets in various foreign countries and potentially additional transportation costs. At times, management must consider probability, weighting various viable alternatives, in its determination of the net realizable value of the inventories. These assumptions and probabilities are subjective in nature and are based on management’s best estimates and judgments existing at the time of preparation. Changes in future market prices or facts and circumstances could result in a material write down in the value of inventory or decreased future margins on the sale of inventory.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The recoverability of long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Some of the key assumptions utilized in determining future projected cash flows include estimated growth rates, expected future sales prices, estimated costs, royalty rates and terminal values. In some cases, judgment is also required in assigning probability weighting to the various future cash flow scenarios. The probability weighting percentages used, and the various future projected cash flow models prepared by management are based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of preparation and management’s best estimates and judgment of future operating results. Seaboard cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of long-lived assets, which include, but are not limited to, a change in the business climate, government incentives, a negative change in relationships with significant customers, and changes to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. Changes in these facts, circumstances and management’s estimates and judgment could result in an impairment of property, plant and equipment or definite-lived intangibles, resulting in a material charge to earnings.
Lease liabilities and right of use assets - For leases other than short-term leases, Seaboard recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities based primarily on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at lease commencement. As Seaboard’s leases do not have readily determinable implicit discount rates, Seaboard adjusts its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate that would be required to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Seaboard determines the incremental borrowing rates for its leases by adjusting the local risk-free interest rate on its Term Loan due 2028 with a credit risk premium corresponding to Seaboard’s unreported credit rating. Estimation of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment by management and reflects an assessment of Seaboard’s credit standing to derive an implied secured credit rating and corresponding yield curve. The discount rate is further impacted by Seaboard’s global footprint, operating in more than 45 countries with diverse economies, and related foreign currency rates. Changes in management’s estimates of discount rate assumptions could result in a significant overstatement or understatement of right of use assets or lease liabilities, resulting in an adverse impact to Seaboard’s financial position.
Equity Method Investments - Seaboard has numerous investments in and advances to various businesses that it owns 50% or less and are accounted for using the equity method. In addition, for some of these investments, Seaboard also has notes receivable for loans it provided to these businesses. For the CT&M segment, these investments are primarily in foreign countries, which are less developed than the U.S., and therefore, expose Seaboard to greater financial risks. At certain times when there are ongoing operating losses, local economies are depressed, commodity-based markets are less stable, or foreign governments cause challenging business conditions, the fair value of the equity method investment is evaluated by management. The fair value of these investments is not readily determinable as almost all of these investments are not publicly traded. Management will use other methods to determine fair value such as estimated future cash flows, including assumptions on growth rates, for the business and consideration of other local business conditions as applicable. In addition, Seaboard may need to write down any affiliate or notes receivables to estimated realizable value. Information and events creating uncertainty about the realization of recorded amounts for notes include, but are not limited to, the estimated cash flows to be generated by the affiliate’s business, the sufficiency of collateral securing the amounts, the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved, and the consideration of other local business conditions as applicable. Changes in facts, circumstances and management’s estimates and judgment could result in a material charge to earnings.
Income Taxes - Income taxes are determined by management based on current tax regulations in the various worldwide taxing jurisdictions in which Seaboard conducts its business. In various situations, accruals have been made for estimates of the tax effects for certain transactions, business structures, the estimated reversal of timing differences and future projected profitability of Seaboard’s various business units based on management’s interpretation of existing facts, circumstances and tax regulations. Should new evidence come to management’s attention that could alter previous
conclusions or if taxing authorities disagree with the positions taken by Seaboard, the change in estimate could result in a material adverse or favorable impact on the financial statements.
Accrued Pension Liability - The measurement of Seaboard’s pension liability and related expense is dependent on a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding future events. These assumptions include discount rates, assumed rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality rates and retirement rates. The discount rate and return on plan assets are important elements of liability and expense measurement and are reviewed on an annual basis. The effect of decreasing both the discount rate and assumed rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points would be a decrease in pension expense of approximately $1 million per year. The effects of actual results differing from the assumptions (i.e. gains or losses) are primarily accumulated in accrued pension liability and amortized over future periods if it exceeds the 10% corridor and, therefore, could affect Seaboard’s recognized pension expense in such future periods, as permitted under GAAP. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the pension rates and assumptions.
Item 7A.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
DERIVATIVE INFORMATION
Seaboard is exposed to various types of market risks in its day-to-day operations. Primary market risk exposures result from changing commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Occasionally derivatives are used to manage these overall market risks; however, Seaboard does not perform the extensive record-keeping required to account for derivative transactions as hedges. Management believes it uses derivatives primarily as economic hedges, although they do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. Since these derivatives are not accounted for as hedges, fluctuations in the related prices could have a material impact on earnings in any given year. From time to time, Seaboard also enters into speculative derivative transactions related to its market risks.
Commodity price changes affect the cost of necessary raw materials and other inventories, finished product sales and firm sales commitments. Seaboard uses various grain, oilseed and other commodity futures and options purchase contracts to manage certain risks of increasing prices of raw materials and firm sales commitments or anticipated sales contracts. Short sales contracts are used to offset the open purchase derivatives when the related commodity inventory is purchased in advance of the derivative maturity, effectively offsetting the initial futures or option purchase contract. From time to time, hog futures are used to manage risks of increasing prices of hogs acquired for processing, and hog futures are used to manage risks of fluctuating prices of pork product inventories and related future sales. Inventories that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices, including carrying amounts as December 31, 2019 and 2018, are presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
The political and economic conditions of the countries in which Seaboard does business, along with fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, cause volatility in currency exchange rates, which exposes Seaboard to fluctuating foreign currency gains and losses that cannot be predicted. Since changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the cash paid or received on foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, Seaboard manages certain of these risks through the use of foreign currency exchange agreements. Also, since changes in interest rates affect the cash required to service variable-rate debt, Seaboard sometimes uses interest rate exchange agreements to manage risks of increasing interest rates.
Equity price risk is the risk that Seaboard may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities it holds in its short-term investment portfolio. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of Seaboard’s marketable equity securities was approximately $910 million and $878 million, respectively. Seaboard enters into equity futures contracts to manage the equity price risk with respect to certain short-term investments.
The following table presents the sensitivity of the fair value of Seaboard’s open net commodity future and option contracts, foreign currency exchange agreements and marketable equity securities to a hypothetical 10% change in market prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For all open derivatives, the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each item by valuing each net position at quoted market prices as of the applicable date.
The table below provides information about Seaboard’s long-term debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2019. For this variable rate debt, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
Long-term debt sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 totaled $735 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.16%.
Item 8.","Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Seaboard Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seaboard Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842).
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of lease liabilities
As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were $528 million. The lease liability represents the obligation to make the lease payments arising from leases, measured on a discounted basis, using an estimated incremental borrowing rate.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s lease liability recorded as of January 1, 2019, the transition date for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), to be a critical audit matter.
Specialized skills were required to evaluate the Company’s assumptions used to determine the lease liability, specifically the incremental borrowing rates.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s lease liability determination process including controls to evaluate the incremental borrowing rates used to calculate the lease liability. We involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in understanding the Company’s methodology and assumptions used to determine the incremental borrowing rates. The valuation professional also assisted us in developing an independent estimate of the incremental borrowing rates. We compared the independent estimate of the incremental borrowing rates to those utilized by the Company, and we performed sensitivity analyses over the incremental borrowing rates to assess the impact on the Company’s calculation of the lease liability.
Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company earned $6.8 billion of revenue in 2019. The revenue was primarily generated by the Pork, Commodity, Trading and Milling, Marine, Sugar and Alcohol, and Power reporting segments. Within these reporting segments, the Company has operating locations associated with consolidated entities in over 45 countries. Revenue generated based on the location of the operations sourcing the product or service primarily resides within the United States, Colombia, and South Africa, and comprised 42% of revenue. The remaining 58% of revenue was sourced from other countries throughout the Caribbean, Central, and South America, Africa, Pacific Basin and Far East, Canada/Mexico, Europe, and other countries.
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. The geographical dispersion of revenue required especially subjective auditor judgment in determining which locations to perform procedures and evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence. Furthermore, given the time zone, language and business composition differences between countries, our audit team consisted of auditors located in multiple countries around the world.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the nature and amounts of the Company’s revenue at its various locations and applied auditor judgment to determine the locations at which procedures were to be performed. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s revenue process, including controls related to the recognition and consolidation of global revenue amounts. We tested a sample of individual revenue transactions by comparing the amounts recognized by the Company to relevant underlying documentation such as contracts. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1959.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Operations of Seaboard Corporation and its Subsidiaries
Seaboard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Seaboard”) together comprise a diverse global agribusiness and transportation company. In the United States (“U.S.”), Seaboard is primarily engaged in hog production and pork processing and ocean transportation. Overseas, Seaboard is primarily engaged in commodity merchandising, grain processing, sugar and alcohol production and electric power generation. Seaboard also has an equity method investment in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a producer and processor of branded and non-branded turkey products. Approximately 77% of the outstanding common stock of Seaboard is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC.
Principles of Consolidation and Investments in Affiliates
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Seaboard Corporation and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in non-controlled affiliates where we have significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Financial information from certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity. As Seaboard conducts its agricultural commodity trading business with third parties, consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates on an interrelated basis, cost of sales on affiliates cannot be clearly distinguished without making numerous assumptions, primarily with respect to mark-to-market accounting for commodity derivatives.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, potential write down related to investments in and advances to affiliates and notes receivable from affiliates, income taxes, lease liabilities and right of use (“ROU”) assets and accrued pension liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation
Seaboard has operations in several foreign countries, and the currencies of the countries fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Certain of the major contracts and transactions, however, are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates in relation to the currencies of countries where certain of Seaboard’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates primarily conduct business. These fluctuations result in exchange gains and losses. The activities of these foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily conducted with U.S. subsidiaries or operate in hyper-inflationary environments. As a result, the financial statements of certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are re-measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Certain CT&M segment consolidated subsidiaries located in Brazil, Canada, Guyana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia use local currency as their functional currency. Also, certain non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates of the CT&M and Sugar and Alcohol segments use local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated at average rates. Translation gains and losses are recorded as components of other comprehensive income (loss). For the consolidated subsidiaries and non-consolidated affiliates, U.S. dollar denominated net asset or liability conversions to the local currency are recorded through income.
GAAP requires the use of highly inflationary accounting for countries whose cumulative three-year inflation exceeds 100%. In the second quarter of 2018, the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar, which along with increased inflation, indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in that country exceeded 100%. As a result, Seaboard adopted highly inflationary accounting as of July 1, 2018 for Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment. Under highly inflationary accounting, the Sugar and Alcohol segment’s functional currency became the U.S. dollar, and its income statement and balance sheet are measured in U.S. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), net. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard recognized $(3) million and $9 million in foreign currency gains (losses) related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting as a result of its net monetary liability position.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, management considers all demand deposits, overnight investments and other investments with original maturities less than three months as cash equivalents.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $137 million, all included in net cash from operating activities. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of finance lease liabilities was $3 million, with principal payments of $2 million included in financing activities and interest of $1 million included in operating activities. Seaboard reports the amortization of ROU assets and the change in operating lease liabilities in other liabilities, exclusive of debt in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified operating and finance lease liabilities were $95 million and $46 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other non-cash activities were related to the non-cash consideration paid in the acquisitions discussed further in Note 2, including incurrence of debt and contingent consideration.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments are categorized as trading securities and reported at their estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in other investment income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Purchases and sales are recorded on a settlement date basis, and gains and losses on investment sales are generally based on the specific identification method. Short-term investments are retained for future use in the business.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. The Power segment, however, collects interest on certain past due accounts, and the Commodity Trading and Milling (“CT&M”) segment provides extended payment terms for certain customers in certain countries due to local market conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is Seaboard’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. For most operating segments, Seaboard uses a specific identification approach to determine, in management’s judgment, the collection value of certain past due accounts based on contractual terms. For the Marine segment, the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an aging percentage methodology primarily based on historical write-off experience. Seaboard reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Management believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and reduces receivables recorded to their expected net realizable value. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard had gross non-affiliate foreign receivables of approximately $309 million and $327 million, respectively, which generally represent more of a collection risk than the domestic receivables, although as of December 31, 2019 no individual material amounts were deemed to have a heightened risk of collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The activity within the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
(a)  During 2019 and 2018, $5 million and $7 million, respectively, of the provision was charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2017, $12 million of the provision was charged to selling, general and administrative expenses, $2 million to income from affiliates related to reserves on convertible notes and $2 million to cost of sales related to a rebate reserve.
(b)  Includes write-offs net of recoveries, foreign currency translation adjustments and other adjustments.
Notes Receivable
Seaboard monitors the credit quality of notes receivable, the majority of which are from its affiliates. For notes receivable from affiliates, Seaboard obtains and reviews financial information on a monthly basis and Seaboard representatives serve on their Board of Directors. If it is indicated based on current information and events it is probable that Seaboard will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the notes receivable and an amount can be reasonably estimated, Seaboard reduces the notes receivable to estimated realizable value.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The activity within the allowance for notes receivable was as follows:
Inventories
Seaboard uses the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market for determining inventory cost of hogs, fresh pork products and related materials. Grain, flour and feed inventories at foreign milling operations are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. All other inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and are being depreciated on the straight-line method over useful lives, ranging from 3 to 30 years. Property, plant and equipment under finance leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments and subsequently amortized using the straight-line method over the earlier of the end of its useful life or the end of the lease term. Routine and planned major maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The present value of lease payments is determined primarily using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. Seaboard has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all classes of underlying assets. Short-term leases are leases with terms greater than 1 month, but less than 12 months. Also, Seaboard elected to account for lease and nonlease maintenance components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment by each reporting unit at the quarter end closest to the anniversary date of the acquisition, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is likely. Any one event or a combination of events such as change in the business climate, a negative change in relationships with significant customers and changes to strategic decisions, including decisions to expand made in response to economic or competitive conditions, could require an interim assessment prior to the next required annual assessment. If qualitative factors indicate more likely than not an impairment is possible, Seaboard performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the annual assessment conducted by these reporting units, there were no impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Separable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment similar to property, plant and equipment discussed above. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for finite-lived intangible were as follows:
Amortization of intangible assets was $8 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Using the exchange rates in effect at year-end, estimated amortization of intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 was as follows: $8 million in 2020, $8 million in 2021, $8 million in 2022, $8 million in 2023, $8 million in 2024 and $18 million thereafter.
Accrued Self-Insurance
Seaboard is self-insured for certain levels of workers’ compensation, health care coverage, property damage, vehicle, product recall and general liability. The cost of these self-insurance programs is accrued based upon estimated settlements for known and anticipated claims. Changes in estimates to previously recorded reserves are reflected in current operating results.
Asset Retirement Obligation
Seaboard has recorded long-lived assets and a related liability for the asset retirement obligation costs associated with the closure of the hog lagoons it is legally obligated to close in the future should Seaboard cease operations or plan to close such lagoons voluntarily in accordance with a changed operating plan. Based on detailed assessments and appraisals obtained to estimate the future asset retirement obligation costs, Seaboard recorded the present value of the projected costs in non-current other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with the retirement asset depreciated over the economic life of the related asset. The following table shows the changes in the asset retirement obligation:
Revenue Recognition
Seaboard recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The majority of Seaboard’s revenue arrangements consist of a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual product or service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, including shipping and handling and customary storage, and, therefore, not distinct. Seaboard’s transaction prices are mostly fixed, but occasionally include minimal variable consideration for early payment, volume and other similar discounts, which are highly probable based on the history with the respective customers. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are collected by Seaboard from a customer are excluded from sales.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Seaboard recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values. Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness. Derivatives qualify for treatment as hedges for accounting purposes when there is a high correlation between the change in fair value of the instrument and the related change in value of the underlying commitment. Additionally, in order to designate a derivative financial instrument as a hedge for accounting purposes, extensive record keeping is required. For derivatives that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes, the change in fair value has no net impact on earnings, to the extent the derivative is considered effective, until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument, the change in fair value affects current period net earnings.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Seaboard uses derivative instruments to manage various types of market risks, including primarily commodity futures and option contracts, foreign currency exchange agreements, interest rate exchange agreements and equity future contracts. While management believes each of these instruments are primarily entered into in order to effectively manage various market risks, as of December 31, 2019, none of the derivatives were designated and accounted for as hedges, primarily as a result of the extensive record-keeping requirements. From time to time, Seaboard also enters into speculative derivative transactions not directly related to its raw materials requirements.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities.
Earnings Per Common Share
Earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for all periods presented.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted
On January 1, 2019, Seaboard adopted guidance which requires the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases. As a result of this adoption, Seaboard recorded operating lease ROU assets of $460 million, adjusted for the deferred rent liability balance as of December 31, 2018, and lease liabilities of $498 million. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows. The accounting for finance leases, formerly called capital leases, remained substantially unchanged. Seaboard adopted the new guidance using the effective date method and, therefore, prior period financials were not revised. Seaboard elected the package of practical expedients available upon transition, which permitted Seaboard to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. See Note 6 for additional details on the impact of adopting this new accounting standard.
On January 1, 2018, Seaboard adopted guidance that eliminated cost method accounting and requires measuring equity investments, other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, at fair value and recognizing fair value changes in net income if a readily determinable fair value exists. On January 1, 2018, $7 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss was reclassified to retained earnings by means of a cumulative effect adjustment, and all future gains/losses on these equity investments is reflected in other investment income (loss), net.
Seaboard early adopted guidance that permitted companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. Seaboard reclassified $45 million of tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on the measurement of financial instrument credit losses that requires, among other things, the use of a new current expected credit loss (""CECL"") model in order to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable and notes receivable. The CECL model requires estimation of lifetime expected credit loss based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. The new guidance replaces the existing incurred loss model and will be effective for Seaboard on January 1, 2020. Seaboard expects the cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings will be less than $5 million.
In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and improves consistent application of GAAP for other areas by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This guidance is effective for Seaboard on January 1, 2021. Seaboard is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on its disclosures.
Note 2 - Acquisitions
On October 28, 2019, Seaboard’s CT&M segment increased its ownership percentage from 50% to 100% to obtain control of ContiLatin del Peru S.A., an importer and trader of grains in Peru (“CLDP”). Seaboard accounted for this transaction as a business combination achieved in stages. Total consideration for the purchase price included $7 million of cash paid, net of $2 million cash acquired, Seaboard’s previously held equity interest in CLDP remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value of $9 million and pre-existing affiliate trade receivables fair valued at the acquisition date of $13 million.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Seaboard is currently completing the fair value assessment of the acquired assets and liabilities and any adjustments identified in the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, will be accounted for prospectively. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation resulting from this consolidation:
Goodwill represents CLDP’s market presence and its experienced workforce. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net sales of $87 million and net loss of $2 million were recognized in Seaboard’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations are not presented as the effects are not material to Seaboard’s results of operations. Seaboard incurred no acquisition costs.
On January 5, 2018, Seaboard’s CT&M segment acquired substantially all of the outstanding common shares of Borisniak Corp., Les Grands Moulins d’Abidjan, Les Grands Moulins de Dakar, Eurafrique, and Societe Mediterraneenne de Transport, collectively operating as Groupe Mimran (“Mimran”). Mimran operates three flour mills and an associated grain trading business located in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Monaco. This acquisition increased Seaboard’s flour and feed milling capacity and annual grain trading volume.
The total purchase price for this acquisition based on the acquisition date fair values and using the exchange rate in effect at the time of acquisition, was $324 million consisting of:
See Note 8 for further description of the note payable. The fair value of the contingent consideration, classified in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, is dependent on the probability of Mimran achieving certain financial performance targets using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as a metric. The contingent consideration ranges between zero and $48 million payable between five and eight years following the closing, at the discretion of the sellers. The note payable and the contingent consideration are noncash transactions that were excluded from the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation resulting from this acquisition:
The intangible assets include $28 million allocated to trade names, amortizable over 9 years, and $50 million allocated to customer relationships, amortizable over 9 years. Goodwill represents Mimran’s market presence and its experienced workforce. The intangible assets and goodwill are not deductible for income tax purposes.
Certain Mimran entities acquired are accounted for on a three-month lag and use local currency as their functional currency. Translation gains and losses are recorded as components of other comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales of $247 million and net earnings of $17 million were recognized in Seaboard’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs incurred primarily in 2017, of $2 million were expensed in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined consolidated financial results for Seaboard as if the acquisition had been completed at January 1, 2017:
Note 3 - Investments
The following is a summary of the estimated fair value of short-term investments classified as trading securities:
The change in unrealized gains (losses) related to trading securities still held at the end of the respective reporting period was $176 million, $(110) million and $146 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Seaboard had $62 million of equity securities denominated in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2019, with $32 million in euros, $12 million in Japanese yen, $8 million in the British pound and the remaining $10 million in various other currencies. Seaboard had $66 million of equity securities denominated in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2018, with $25 million in euros, $20 million in Japanese yen, $9 million in the British pound and the remaining $12 million in

various other currencies. Seaboard had $13 million of debt securities denominated in euros as of December 31, 2019. Also, money market funds included less than $1 million and $10 million denominated in various foreign currencies as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In addition to its short-term investments, Seaboard also has trading securities related to Seaboard’s deferred compensation plans classified in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 for information on the types of trading securities held related to the deferred compensation plans. See Note 10 for a discussion of assets held in conjunction with investments related to Seaboard’s defined benefit pension plan.
Note 4 - Inventories
The following table is a summary of inventories:
The use of the LIFO method for certain inventories of the Pork segment decreased net earnings $5 million ($4.10 per common share), $20 million ($16.87 per common share) and $6 million ($5.40 per common share) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, after taxes were considered. If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories of the Pork segment, inventories would have been higher by $64 million and $58 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The LIFO valuation reserve activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:
Note 5 - Net Property, Plant and Equipment
The following table is a summary of property, plant and equipment:
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Finance lease ROU assets of $50 million, net of $3 million in accumulated amortization, are included in property, plant and equipment and comprise all of the contract growers asset category, with the remaining balance in buildings, machinery and equipment and land.
Seaboard’s capitalized interest on construction in progress was $7 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note 6 - Leases
Seaboard’s operating leases are primarily for ports, vessels, contract grower assets, and to a lesser extent, land, buildings and machinery and equipment. Seaboard’s finance leases are primarily for contract grower assets. Seaboard’s Marine segment leases its PortMiami terminal, among other ports. The Marine and CT&M segments lease vessels for use in operations. The Pork segment has contract grower agreements in place with farmers to raise a portion of Seaboard’s hogs using the farmer’s buildings, land and equipment. Seaboard’s nonlease components are primarily for services related to labor associated with caring for hogs in its contract grower agreements and crew services on vessel charter arrangements.
As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term for Seaboard’s operating and finance leases was approximately six years and nine years, respectively. Seaboard’s lease terms vary depending upon the class of asset and some leases include options to extend or terminate. Since Seaboard is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal or termination options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments or penalties are excluded from lease payments.
Seaboard’s operating lease assets and liabilities are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet. The classification of Seaboard’s finance leases in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:
The components of lease cost for 2019 were as follows:
Operating lease cost and short-term lease cost are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease cost is recognized based on the effective interest method for the lease liability and straight-line amortization of the ROU asset. Variable lease payments are recognized when the circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs. Variable lease payments are primarily for payments in excess of minimums with regards to throughput of shipping containers. Short-term leases are primarily for containers and vessels at Seaboard’s Marine segment. Lease cost is included in various line items in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or capitalized to inventory. Rental expense for leases with terms of a month or less are excluded from the total lease cost above.
Rental expense for facility and equipment operating leases for all segments was $46 million and $44 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Marine and CT&M segments’ vessel charter hire expenses during 2018 and 2017 totaled $111 million and $96 million, respectively. The Pork segment paid $48 million and $37 million for contract grower agreements in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Maturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:
Seaboard’s weighted average discount rate for operating and finances leases was 6.58% and 6.31%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. There were estimates and judgments made in determining Seaboard’s multiple discount rates based on term, country and currency, including developing a secured credit rating and spreading market yield data across maturities and country risk-free rates.
Below is Seaboard’s commitments table as of December 31, 2018 that disclosed operating lease payments for the next five years and thereafter. Seaboard had no material capital leases as of December 31, 2018.
Note 7 - Equity Method Investments
Seaboard has several investments in and advances to non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates that are all accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 15 for detail of the investments in and advances to affiliates by segment. Financial information from certain foreign affiliates is reported on a one- to three-month lag, depending on the specific entity.
The Pork segment has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily’s Premium Meats, LLC (“Daily’s”) and STF. Daily’s produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon. STF operates a pork processing plant, which began operations in September 2017. Seaboard’s Pork segment supplies raw materials to both of these facilities for processing and provides marketing services to STF for its pork products. Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above.
Seaboard and Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”) formed STF in May 2015 with equal ownership of 50%. In connection with the development and operation of the plant, Seaboard contributed $73 million during 2017. Also, Seaboard agreed to provide a portion of the hogs to be processed at the plant. The Pork segment currently has a business relationship with Triumph under which Seaboard markets substantially all of the pork products produced at Triumph’s plant in Missouri and STF’s plant in Iowa.

The CT&M segment has noncontrolling interests in foreign businesses conducting flour, maize and feed milling, baking operations, poultry production and processing, and agricultural commodity trading. Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above. As of December 31, 2019, the location and percentage ownership of CT&M’s affiliates were as follows: Botswana (50%), Democratic Republic of Congo (50%), Gambia (50%), Kenya (46.64%-49%), Lesotho (50%), Mauritania (50%), Morocco (11.44%-17.08%), Nigeria (25%-48.33%), Senegal (49%), South Africa (30%-50%), Tanzania (49%) and Zambia (49%) in Africa; Colombia (40%-42%), Ecuador (25%-50%), Guyana (50%), and Peru (50%) in South America; Jamaica (50%) and Haiti (23.33%) in the Caribbean; Turkey (25%) in Europe; Australia (22.5%-25%); and Canada (45%) and the U.S. (40%) in North America. As of December 31, 2019, the CT&M segment’s carrying value of certain investments in affiliates was more than its share of the affiliates’ book value by $56 million. The excess is attributable primarily to the valuation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The amortizable assets are being amortized to income (loss) from affiliates over the remaining life of the assets.
During 2018, Seaboard’s CT&M segment acquired a 50% noncontrolling interest in a grain trading and flour milling business in Mauritania for total consideration of $16 million.
The Marine segment has a 21% noncontrolling interest in a cargo terminal business in Jamaica and a 18% noncontrolling interest in a holding company that owns a Caribbean terminal operation. Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above. As of December 31, 2018, the Marine segment’s carrying value of certain investments in affiliates was less than its share of the affiliates’ book value by $29 million. The difference is attributable primarily to the valuation of property, plant and equipment and impairments taken by Seaboard, but not the respective entity. Certain basis adjustments are being amortized to income (loss) from affiliates over the remaining life of the assets.
The Sugar and Alcohol segment has noncontrolling interests in two sugar-related businesses in Argentina (46% and 50%). Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Power segment has noncontrolling interests in two energy-related businesses in the Dominican Republic (45% and 50%). In September 2019, Seaboard’s Power segment sold its 29.9% noncontrolling interest in a Dominican Republic electricity generation facility for $23 million cash, net of $1 million in selling expenses and taxes and recorded a $6 million note receivable in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There was no gain or loss recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income upon the sale. Combined condensed financial information of these entities for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above.
The Turkey segment represents Seaboard’s 50% noncontrolling interest in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a vertically integrated producer and processor of branded and non-branded turkey products. Butterball’s condensed financial information for each of Seaboard’s years ended is included in the table above. Within total assets, Butterball had trade name intangible assets of $111 million and goodwill of $66 million as of December 31, 2019.
In connection with its initial investment in Butterball in December 2010, Seaboard provided Butterball with a $100 million unsecured subordinated loan that had a cash and compounded pay-in-kind interest component. In December 2017, Butterball fully repaid the loan that accumulated to $164 million and accrued interest of $6 million. Seaboard holds warrants, which upon exercise for a nominal price, would enable Seaboard to acquire an additional 5% equity interest in Butterball. The warrants qualify for equity treatment under accounting standards and are classified as investments in and advances to affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. Seaboard can exercise these warrants at any time after December 31, 2018 or prior to December 31, 2025 after which time the warrants expire. Butterball has the right to repurchase the warrants for fair market value. The warrant agreement essentially provides Seaboard with a 52.5% economic interest, as these warrants are in substance an additional equity interest. Therefore, Seaboard records 52.5% of Butterball’s earnings as income (loss) from affiliates in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. However, all significant corporate governance matters would continue to be shared equally between Seaboard and its partner in Butterball even if the warrants were exercised, unless Seaboard already owned a majority of the voting rights at the time of exercise.

Note 8 - Lines of Credit and Long-Term Debt
The outstanding balance under uncommitted lines of credit was $246 million and $148 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the $246 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019, $189 million was denominated in foreign currencies, with $91 million denominated in the South African rand, $53 million in the Peruvian sol, $24 million denominated in the Canadian dollar, $19 million denominated in the Zambian kwacha and the remaining in various other currencies. The weighted average interest rate for outstanding uncommitted lines of credit was 5.79% and 7.76% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The uncommitted lines of credit are unsecured and do not require compensating balances. Facility fees on these agreements are not material.
Seaboard has a $100 million committed line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association that had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019, Seaboard renewed this credit line through September 25, 2020, with no other changes to the agreement. Interest is computed at LIBOR plus 0.50%, and Seaboard incurs an unused commitment fee of 0.09% per annum. This line of credit is secured by certain short-term investments and is subject to standard representations and covenants. As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard’s borrowing capacity under its uncommitted and committed lines of credit was reduced by the $246 million drawn and $18 million of letters of credit.
Long-term Debt
Long-term debt includes borrowings under term loans and other contractual obligations for payment, including notes payable. The following table is a summary of long-term debt:
On September 25, 2018, Seaboard Foods LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with CoBank, ACB, Farm Credit Services of America, PCA, and the lenders party thereto. This Credit Agreement replaced Seaboard Foods LLC’s $500 million unsecured term loan with a $700 million unsecured term loan (“Term Loan”) and extended the maturity from December 4, 2022 to September 25, 2028. Seaboard Foods LLC received proceeds of $220 million, net of certain costs. The Term Loan provides for quarterly payments of the principal balance pursuant to the revised amortization schedule set forth in the Credit Agreement, with the balance due on the maturity date. The Term Loan bears interest at fluctuating rates based on various margins over a Base Rate, LIBOR or a Quoted Rate, at the option of the borrower. The interest rate was 3.42% and 4.15% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Term Loan requires, among other terms, the maintenance of certain ratios involving a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, which shall not exceed 50% at the end of any fiscal quarter, and minimum tangible net worth, as defined, of not less than $2.5 billion plus 25% of cumulative consolidated net income. The Term Loan also includes restrictions of certain subsidiaries to grant liens on assets, incur indebtedness over 15% of consolidated tangible net worth, make certain acquisitions, investments and asset dispositions in excess of specified amounts, and limits aggregate dividend payments to $100 million per year under certain circumstances. Seaboard Corporation has guaranteed all obligations of Seaboard Foods LLC under the Term Loan.
Foreign subsidiary long-term debt is primarily denominated in euros and U.S. dollars. In conjunction with the acquisition discussed in Note 2, Seaboard incurred a euro-denominated note payable due to the sellers with a balance of $44 million as of December 31, 2019. The change in value from the date of acquisition to the current reporting period reflects foreign currency fluctuations and the accretion of the discount to the note payable face value over the term that is recorded as additional interest expense. This foreign subsidiary obligation bears interest at an annual rate of 3.25%, with interest due annually on the anniversary date, until maturity on January 5, 2021. Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment, which is on a one-month lag, has notes payable outstanding of $54 million and $29 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively with maturity dates that range from December 9, 2019 to December 30, 2019. The interest rate on the Sugar and Alcohol segment’s notes payable was 3.20% and 3.10% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of all foreign subsidiary debt was 3.50% and 3.80% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All of the foreign subsidiary debt is guaranteed by Seaboard, except $1 million is secured by property, plant and equipment.

Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
On June 28, 2018, Wanda Duryea and eleven other indirect purchasers of pork products, acting on behalf of themselves and a putative class of indirect purchasers of pork products, filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (the “District Court”) against several pork processors, including Seaboard Foods LLC and Agri Stats, Inc., a company described in the complaint as a data sharing service. Subsequent to the filing of this initial complaint, additional class action complaints making similar claims on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers were filed in the District Court. The complaints were amended and consolidated for pre-trial purposes, into three consolidated putative class actions brought on behalf of (a) direct purchasers, (b) consumer indirect purchasers and (c) commercial and institutional indirect purchasers. The amended complaints named Seaboard Corporation as an additional defendant. The consolidated actions are styled In re Pork Antitrust Litigation. Subsequent to the original filings, two additional actions making similar claims, including one by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, were brought in or transferred to the District Court. The complaints alleged, among other things, that beginning in January 2009, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of pork products in violation of U.S. antitrust laws by coordinating their output and limiting production, allegedly facilitated by the exchange of non-public information about prices, capacity, sales volume and demand through Agri Stats, Inc. The complaints on behalf of the putative classes of indirect purchasers also included causes of action under various state laws, including state antitrust laws, unfair competition laws, consumer protection statutes and state common law claims for unjust enrichment. The complaints also alleged that the defendants concealed this conduct from the plaintiffs and the members of the putative classes. The relief sought in the respective complaints includes treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative classes. On August 8, 2019, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the class action cases while giving the plaintiffs leave to amend. The classes and the other two plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November and December 2019. In addition to amending the original claims, the consumer indirect purchasers have asserted a new claim alleging that the exchange of information by defendants through Agri Stats Inc. unreasonably restrained trade. On January 15, 2020, the defendants, including Seaboard, moved to dismiss the amended complaints. Seaboard intends to defend these cases vigorously. It is impossible at this stage either to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from these suits, or to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss or range of potential loss, if any, resulting from the suits.
On March 20, 2018, the bankruptcy trustee (the “Trustee”) for Cereoil Uruguay S.A. (“Cereoil”) filed a suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard and Seaboard’s subsidiaries, Seaboard Overseas Limited (“SOL”) and Seaboard Uruguay Holdings Ltd. (“Seaboard Uruguay”). Seaboard has a 45% indirect ownership of Cereoil. The suit seeks an order requiring Seaboard, SOL and Seaboard Uruguay to reimburse Cereoil the amount of $22 million, contending that deliveries of soybeans to SOL pursuant to purchase agreements should be set aside as fraudulent conveyances. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and its two subsidiaries could be ordered to pay the amount of $22 million. Any award in this case would offset against any award in the additional case described below filed by the Trustee on April 27, 2018.
On April 27, 2018, the Trustee for Cereoil filed another suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard, SOL, Seaboard Uruguay, all directors of Cereoil, including two individuals employed by Seaboard who served as directors at the behest of Seaboard, and the Chief Financial Officer of Cereoil, an employee of Seaboard who also served at the behest of Seaboard (collectively, the “Cereoil Defendants”). The Trustee contends that the Cereoil Defendants acted with willful misconduct to cause Cereoil’s insolvency, and thus should be ordered to pay all liabilities of Cereoil, net of assets. The bankruptcy filing lists total liabilities of $53 million and assets of $30 million. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants could be ordered to pay the amount of the net indebtedness of Cereoil, which based on the bankruptcy schedules would total $23 million. It is possible that the net indebtedness could be higher than this amount if Cereoil’s liabilities are greater than $53 million and/or Cereoil’s assets are worth less than $30 million.

In addition, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance could order payment of the Trustee’s professional fees, interest, and other expenses. Any award in this case would offset against any award in the case described above filed on March 20, 2018.
A creditor of Cereoil which has a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding pending in Uruguay of approximately $10 million, plus accrued interest, has threatened to bring legal action in the U.S. against Seaboard alleging on various legal theories that Seaboard is responsible for this same indebtedness. Seaboard will vigorously defend this action should it be brought.
On May 15, 2018, the Trustee for Nolston S.A. (“Nolston”) filed a suit in the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance in Uruguay that was served during the second quarter of 2018 naming as parties Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants. Seaboard has a 45% indirect ownership of Nolston. The Trustee contends that the Cereoil Defendants acted with willful misconduct to cause Nolston’s insolvency, and thus should be ordered to pay all liabilities of Nolston, net of assets. The bankruptcy filing lists total liabilities of $29 million and assets of $15 million. Seaboard intends to defend this case vigorously. It is impossible at this stage to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome resulting from this suit. In the event of an adverse ruling, Seaboard and the other Cereoil Defendants could be ordered to pay the amount of the net indebtedness of Nolston, which based on the bankruptcy schedules would total $14 million. It is possible that the net indebtedness could be higher than this amount if Nolston’s liabilities are greater than $29 million and/or Nolston’s assets are worth less than $15 million. In addition, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Bankruptcy Court of First Instance could order payment of the Trustee’s professional fees, interest, and other expenses.
On September 18, 2014, and subsequently in 2015 and 2016, Seaboard received a number of grand jury subpoenas and informal requests for information from the Department of Justice, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (“AFMLS”), seeking records related to specified foreign companies and individuals. The companies and individuals as to which the requested records relate were not affiliated with Seaboard, although Seaboard has also received subpoenas and requests for additional information relating to an affiliate of Seaboard. During 2017, Seaboard received grand jury subpoenas requesting documents and information related to money transfers and bank accounts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries and requests to interview certain Seaboard employees and to obtain testimony before a grand jury. Seaboard retained outside counsel and cooperated with the government’s investigation. There has been no further communication from AFMLS for more than 18 months and to the knowledge of Seaboard, there has been no further action taken by AFMLS. As such, unless further communication is received from AFMLS or action is taken by AFMLS, disclosure of the matter described in this paragraph will not appear in Seaboard’s future SEC periodic reports.
Seaboard is subject to various administrative and judicial proceedings and other legal matters related to the normal conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these items is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of Seaboard.
Guarantees
Certain of the non-consolidated affiliates and third-party contractors who perform services for Seaboard have bank debt supporting their underlying operations. From time to time, Seaboard will provide guarantees of that debt in order to further Seaboard’s business objectives. Seaboard does not issue guarantees for compensation. As of December 31, 2019, guarantees outstanding were not material. Seaboard has not accrued a liability for any of the guarantees as management considers the likelihood of loss to be remote. See discussion of bank letters of credit in Note 8.

Commitments
As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had various non-cancelable commitments under contractual agreements:
(a)The Pork segment has contracted with third parties for the purchase of hogs to support its operations. The amounts are based on projected market prices as of December 31, 2019. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Pork segment paid $121 million, $77 million and $99 million, respectively, for hogs purchased under committed contracts.
(b)The Pork segment enters into grain purchase contracts to support its hog operations. The amounts are based on projected commodity prices as of December 31, 2019.
(c)The CT&M segment enters into grain purchase contracts, primarily to support firm sales commitments. The amounts are based on projected commodity prices as of December 31, 2019.
(d)The Power segment has a natural gas supply contract for a significant portion of the fuel required for the barge under construction. The commitment has both fixed and variable price components and the amount included is partially based on market prices as of December 31, 2019. The Marine segment also has fuel purchase contracts.
(e)The Power segment’s commitments to the contractor for its new power generating barge, anticipated to begin operations in mid-2021, were approximately $26 million. Contractual costs to complete the Pork segment’s Oklahoma pork processing plant expansion in 2020 totaled approximately $21 million. The Pork segment’s renewable diesel production facility, expected to be operational in early 2022, has commitments of approximately $86 million. Expected payments may vary based on timing of milestones achieved.
Note 10 - Employee Benefits
Seaboard has a qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) for its domestic salaried and clerical employees that were hired before January 1, 2014. Benefits are generally based upon the number of years of service and a percentage of final average pay. Seaboard has historically based pension contributions on minimum funding standards to avoid the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) variable rate premiums established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) of 1974. Seaboard did not make any contributions in 2019 and 2018 and currently does not plan on making any contributions in 2020.
Pursuant to Seaboard’s investment policy, assets are invested in the Plan to achieve a diversified target allocation of approximately 50% in domestic equities, 25% in international equities, 20% in fixed income securities and 5% in alternative investments. The investment strategy is periodically reviewed by management for adherence to policy and performance. The following tables show the Plan’s assets measured at estimated fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the level within the fair value hierarchy used to measure each category of assets:
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Seaboard also sponsors non-qualified, unfunded supplemental executive plans, and has certain individual, non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement agreements for certain retired employees. Management has no plans to provide funding for these supplemental executive plans in advance of when the benefits are paid.
Assumptions used in determining pension information for all of the above plans were:
Management selected the discount rate based on a model-based result where the timing and amount of cash flows approximates the estimated payouts. The expected returns on the Plan’s assets assumption are based on the weighted average of asset class expected returns that are consistent with historical returns. The assumed rate of return selected was based on model-based results that reflect the Plan’s asset allocation and related long-term projected returns. The measurement date for all plans is December 31.
The aggregate changes in the benefit obligation and fair value of assets for the Plan, supplemental executive plans and retirement agreements and the funded status were as follows:
The net funded status of the Plan was $(53) million and $(35) million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The benefit obligation increased primarily due to a decrease in discount rates for all plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the Plan was $205 million and $165 million and for all the other plans was $104 million and $95 million as
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expected future net benefit payments for all plans during each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows: $19 million, $11 million, $29 million, $23 million, $16 million and $82 million, respectively.
The net periodic benefit cost of these plans was as follows:
The service cost component is recorded in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending upon the employee, and the other components of net periodic benefit cost are recorded in miscellaneous, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The amounts not reflected in net periodic benefit cost and included in accumulated other comprehensive loss before taxes as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $88 million and $72 million, respectively. Such amounts primarily represent the unrecognized net actuarial losses that are generally amortized over the average remaining working lifetime of the active participants for all of these plans. The settlements recognized during 2019 and 2017 were primarily due to certain participants who received lump sum payments that exceeded the service cost plus interest cost for the respective plan.
Seaboard participated in a multi-employer pension fund, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union-Industry Pension Fund (the “Fund”), which covered certain union employees under a collective bargaining agreement. Contribution expense for this Fund was $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Effective July 22, 2019, after ratification of a renewed collective bargaining agreement, Seaboard ceased contributing to the Fund, which subsequently terminated Seaboard’s participation in the Fund. Seaboard recorded a $14 million withdrawal liability in 2019, that is payable in quarterly installments over 20 years.
Seaboard maintains a defined contribution plan covering most of its domestic salaried and clerical employees. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, Seaboard contributed to this plan an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of each employee’s contributions to the plan. Employee vesting is based upon years of service, with 20% vested after one year of service and an additional 20% vesting with each additional complete year of service. Contribution expense for this plan was $3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and 2017. In addition, Seaboard maintains a defined contribution plan covering most of its hourly, non-union employees. Contribution expense for this plan was less than $1 million for December 31, 2019 and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Seaboard has a deferred compensation plan that allows certain employees to reduce their compensation in exchange for values in various investments. Seaboard contributes 3% of the employees’ reduced compensation. Seaboard also has an Investment Option Plan that allowed certain employees to reduce their compensation in exchange for an option to acquire interests measured by reference to three investments. Contributions are no longer permitted under the Investment Option Plan. The exercise price for each investment option was established based upon the fair market value of the underlying investment on the date of grant. Seaboard’s income (expense) for these two plans, which primarily includes amounts related to the change in fair value of the underlying investment accounts, was $(11) million, $2 million and $(10) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in other liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $45 million and $38 million, respectively, representing the market value of the payable to the employees upon distribution or exercise for each plan. In conjunction with these plans, Seaboard purchased the specified number of units of the employee-designated investment, plus the applicable option price for the Investment Option Plan. These investments are treated as trading securities and are stated at their fair market values. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $51 million and $45 million, respectively, were included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Investment income (loss) related to the mark-to-market of these investments for 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $11 million, $(2) million and $9 million, respectively.

Note 11 - Derivatives and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1 - Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly, including: quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The following tables show assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the level within the fair value hierarchy used to measure each category of assets and liabilities. The trading securities classified as other current assets below are assets held for Seaboard’s deferred compensation plans.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, net receivables, lines of credit and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments.
Domestic debt securities categorized as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy include debt securities held in mutual funds and ETFs. Domestic debt securities categorized as level 2 include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. Foreign debt securities categorized as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy included debt securities held in mutual funds and ETFs with a country of origin concentration outside the U.S. Foreign debt securities categorized as level 2 include foreign government or government related securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities with a country of origin concentration outside the U.S. High yield securities categorized as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy include high yield securities held in mutual funds and ETFs, and level 2 includes primarily corporate bonds and bank loans.
The fair value of long-term debt is estimated by comparing interest rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As Seaboard’s long-term debt is mostly variable-rate, its carrying amount approximates fair value. If Seaboard’s long-term debt was measured at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets, it would have been classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 8 for a discussion of Seaboard’s long-term debt. The fair value of Seaboard’s contingent consideration related to a 2018 acquisition was classified as a level 3 in the fair value hierarchy since the calculation is dependent upon projected company specific inputs using a Monte Carlo simulation. Seaboard remeasures the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability until settled.
While management believes its derivatives are primarily economic hedges, Seaboard does not perform the extensive record-keeping required to account for these types of transactions as hedges for accounting purposes. As the derivatives discussed below are not accounted for as hedges, fluctuations in the related commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices could have a material impact on earnings in any given reporting period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Commodity Instruments
Seaboard uses various derivative futures and options to manage its risk to price fluctuations for raw materials and other inventories, finished product sales and firm sales commitments. Occasionally, Seaboard also enters into speculative derivative transactions not directly related to its raw material requirements. Commodity derivatives are recorded at fair value, with any changes in fair value being marked-to-market as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had open net derivative contracts to purchase 17 million bushels of grain and open net derivative contracts to sell 132 million pounds of soybean oil and 12 million gallons of heating oil. As of December 31, 2018, Seaboard had open net derivative contracts to purchase 33 million bushels of grain and 8 million pounds of soybean oil and open net derivative contracts to sell 26 million pounds of hogs and 7 million gallons of heating oil.
Foreign Currency Exchange Agreements
Seaboard enters into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange agreements that primarily relate to an underlying commodity transaction are recorded at fair value with changes in value marked-to-market as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency exchange agreements that are not related to an underlying commodity transaction are recorded at fair value with changes in value marked-to-market as a component of foreign currency gains (losses), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard had foreign currency exchange agreements with notional amounts of $78 million and $82 million, respectively, primarily related to the South African rand, euro and the Canadian dollar. From time to time Seaboard is subject to counterparty credit risk related to its foreign currency exchange agreements should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts. As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had a maximum aggregate amount of loss due to credit risk of less than $1 million of credit risk with three counterparties related to its foreign currency exchange agreements. Seaboard does not hold any collateral related to these agreements.
Equity Futures Contracts
Seaboard enters into equity futures contracts to manage the equity price risk with respect to certain short-term investments. Equity futures contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in value marked-to-market as a component of other investment income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The notional amounts of these equity futures contracts were $0 million and $97 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table provides the amount of gain (loss) recognized for each type of derivative and where it was recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
The following table provides the fair value of each type of derivative held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and where each derivative is included in the consolidated balance sheets:
(a)  Seaboard’s commodity derivative assets and liabilities are presented in the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis, including netting the derivatives with the related margin accounts. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the commodity derivatives had a margin account balance of $13 million and $15 million, respectively, resulting in a net other current asset in the consolidated balance sheets of $15 million and $17 million, respectively. Seaboard’s equity derivatives are also presented on a net basis, including netting the derivatives within short-term investments.

Note 12 - Stockholders’ Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
In October 2019, the Board of Directors extended through October 31, 2020 Seaboard’s share repurchase program. Under this share repurchase program, Seaboard is authorized to repurchase its common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated purchases, which may be above or below the traded market price. During the period that the share repurchase program remains in effect, from time to time, Seaboard may enter into a 10b5-1 plan authorizing a third party to make such purchases on behalf of Seaboard. All stock repurchased will be made in compliance with applicable legal requirements and funded by cash on hand. The timing of the repurchases and the number of shares repurchased at any given time will depend upon market conditions, compliance with SEC regulations, and other factors. The Board of Directors’ stock repurchase authorization does not obligate Seaboard to acquire a specific amount of common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended at any time at Seaboard’s discretion. As of December 31, 2019, $78 million remained available for repurchases under this program. Seaboard repurchased 4,369 and 1,333 shares of common stock during 2019 and 2018 at a total price of $17 million and $5 million, respectively. Shares repurchased were retired and became authorized and unissued shares. Seaboard did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 2017.
In each of the four quarters of 2019, Seaboard declared and paid a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share on the common stock. In each of the four quarters of 2018 and 2017, Seaboard declared and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share on the common stock.
The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related taxes, were as follows:
(a)  This primarily represents the amortization of actuarial losses that was included in net periodic pension cost and recorded in operating income. See Note 10 for further discussion.
(b)  Effective January 1, 2018, upon adoption of new guidance, all unrealized gains (losses) on investments were included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The AOCI balance as of December 31, 2017, was reclassified to retained earnings on January 1, 2018.
The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment primarily represents the effect of the Argentine peso currency exchange fluctuation on the net assets of the Sugar and Alcohol segment. Effective in the third quarter of 2018, the Sugar and Alcohol segment’s functional currency changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar due to highly inflationary accounting. See Note 1 for discussion of the functional currency change. During 2019, the foreign currency translation adjustment primarily related to CT&M entities with a functional currency of the West African franc.
Income taxes for the unrecognized pension cost component of accumulated other comprehensive loss was recorded using a 26%effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 and all of 2018 and 2019 and a 39% effective tax rate for other periods of 2017, except for unrecognized pension cost of $21 million, $23 million and $22 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to employees at certain subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recorded.

Note 13 - Revenue Recognition
Seaboard has multiple segments with diverse revenue streams. For additional information on Seaboard’s segments, see Note 15. The following tables presents Seaboard’s sales disaggregated by revenue source and segment:
Revenue from goods and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for approximately 85% of Seaboard’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019. Substantially all of the sales in Seaboard’s Marine segment are recognized ratably over the transit time for each voyage as Seaboard believes this is a faithful depiction of the performance obligation to its customers.
Almost all of Seaboard’s contracts with its customers are short-term, defined as less than one year. Seaboard elected to use all practical expedients and therefore will not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for: (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less; and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Also, Seaboard will recognize a financing component only on obligations that extend longer than one year.
Deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of Seaboard’s performance or revenue billed that is unearned. The CT&M segment requires certain customers to pay in advance or upon delivery to avoid collection risk. The Marine segment’s deferred revenue balance primarily relates to the unearned portion of billed revenue when a ship is on the water and has not arrived at the designated port. Deferred revenue balances are reduced when revenue is recognized. The deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was recognized as revenue during the first quarter of 2019.

Note 14 - Income Taxes
Earnings before income taxes were as follows:
The components of total income taxes were as follows:
Income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 differed from the amounts computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017 to earnings (loss) before income taxes excluding noncontrolling interests for the following reasons:
In December 2019, the President of the U.S. signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (the “2019 Tax Act”) that extended the federal blender’s credits through 2022, with retroactive recognition for 2018 and 2019. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Seaboard recognized non-taxable revenue of $136 million related to the 2018 and 2019 federal blender’s credits on the biodiesel the Pork segment blends. In February 2018, Congress retroactively extended the federal blender’s credits for 2017 and Seaboard recognized a one-time tax benefit of $4 million and non-taxable revenue of $61 million in the first quarter of 2018. There was no federal blender credit revenue recognized in 2017. In accordance
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
with GAAP, the effects of changes in tax laws, including retroactive changes, are recognized in the financial statements in the period that the changes are enacted.
Seaboard has certain investments in various entities that are expected to enable Seaboard to obtain certain investment tax credits. Seaboard has invested in three limited liability companies that operate refined coal processing plants that generate federal income tax credits based on production levels. Seaboard’s total contributions to these long-term investments were $15 million, $17 million and $10 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, Seaboard invested $20 million during 2019 in two limited liability companies involved in a biogas fueled power project that will generate federal income tax credits. These alternative long-term investments, accounted for using the equity method of accounting, generated in aggregate $34 million of investment tax credits for 2019.
During 2018, Seaboard elected to change the tax status of a wholly owned subsidiary from a partnership to a corporation. This change in tax status resulted in an estimated $22 million of additional tax expense and deferred tax liabilities.
On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed into law the Tax Cuts and Job Act (“2017 Tax Act”). Among other things, the 2017 Tax Act lowered corporate income tax rates from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018, imposed a tax on mandatory deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and implemented a territorial tax system. Seaboard recognized $112 million of tax expense related to mandatory deemed repatriated earnings and a $47 million benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Seaboard recorded additional tax expense of $16 million related primarily to repatriation and, to a lesser extent, executive compensation items for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also imposed two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provision effective January 1, 2018. Seaboard accounts for the GILTI and BEAT taxes in the period incurred.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard had income taxes receivable of $14 million and $39 million, respectively, primarily related to domestic tax jurisdictions, and had income taxes payable of $16 million and $14 million, respectively, primarily related to foreign tax jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard has $62 million of long-term income tax liability related to the 2017 Tax Act mandatory deemed repatriated earnings. Expected future payments on this liability were as follows: $2 million in 2021, $6 million in 2022, $6 million in 2023, $12 million in 2024 and $36 million thereafter. The 2017 Tax Act permitted the tax on mandatory deemed repatriated earnings to be paid over eight years.
Seaboard provided for U.S. federal income tax on $1.3 billion of undistributed earnings from foreign operations in conjunction with the 2017 Tax Act. Historically, Seaboard has considered substantially all foreign profits as being permanently invested in its foreign operations, including all cash and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries. Seaboard intends to continue permanently reinvesting the majority of these funds outside the U.S. as current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund Seaboard’s U.S. operations and therefore, Seaboard has not recorded deferred taxes for state or foreign withholding taxes that would result upon repatriation to the U.S. Determination of the tax that might be paid on unremitted earnings if eventually remitted is not practical. If Seaboard decided to repatriate these permanently reinvested earnings to the U.S., Seaboard would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Components of the net deferred income tax liability were as follows:
The activity within the valuation allowance account was as follows:
Management believes Seaboard’s future taxable income will be sufficient for full realization of the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance relates to the tax benefits from state net operating losses and foreign net operating losses and tax credits. Management does not believe these benefits are more likely than not to be realized due to limitations imposed on the utilization of these losses and credits. As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $179 million and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $171 million, a portion of which expire in varying amounts between 2020 and 2039, while others have indefinite expiration periods. As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard had state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $22 million, net of valuation allowance, all of which carry-forward indefinitely.
Seaboard’s tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in material adjustments. Seaboard’s 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 U.S. income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service examination. Tax years prior to 2013 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment. In Seaboard’s major non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ivory Coast and Senegal, tax years are typically subject to examination for three to six years.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Seaboard had $31 million and $25 million, respectively, in total unrecognized tax benefits, all of which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. Seaboard does not have any material uncertain tax positions in which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date.
SEABOARD CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:
Seaboard accrues interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense and had approximately $8 million and $6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note 15 - Segment Information
Seaboard has six reportable segments: Pork, CT&M, Marine, Sugar and Alcohol, Power and Turkey, each offering a specific product or service. Seaboard’s reporting segments are based on information used by Seaboard’s Chief Executive Officer in his capacity as chief operating decision maker to determine allocation of resources and assess performance. Each of the six segments is separately managed, and each was started or acquired independent of the other segments. The Pork segment primarily produces hogs to process and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, distributors and grocery stores throughout the U.S. and to foreign markets. This segment also produces biodiesel from pork fat and other animal fats and vegetable oils for sale to third parties. Substantially all of Seaboard’s Pork segment’s hourly employees at its processing plant are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in 2024. The CT&M segment is an integrated agricultural commodity trading, processing and logistics operation that internationally markets wheat, corn, soybean meal and other agricultural commodities in bulk to third-party customers and to non-consolidated affiliates. This segment also operates flour, maize and feed mills and bakery operations in numerous foreign countries. The Marine segment provides cargo shipping services in the U.S., the Caribbean and Central and South America. The Sugar and Alcohol segment produces and processes sugar and alcohol in Argentina, primarily to be marketed locally. The Power segment is an independent power producer in the Dominican Republic operating a power generating barge. The Turkey segment, accounted for using the equity method, produces turkeys to process and sells branded and non-branded turkey products. Total assets for the Turkey segment represent Seaboard’s investment in Butterball. Revenues for the All Other segment are primarily derived from a jalapeño pepper processing operation. Below are significant segment events that impact financial results for the periods covered by this report.
In February 2019, the Pork segment entered into an asset purchase agreement to buy an idle ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas for approximately $40 million. Seaboard accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition as no workforce or substantive processes were acquired. The purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment based on a relative fair value basis. The Pork segment is converting the Hugoton, Kansas plant to a renewable diesel production facility, with operations expected to begin in 2022. The Pork segment’s biodiesel plants have historically received federal blender’s credits for the biodiesel they blend. As a result of the 2019 Tax Law, Seaboard recognized $60 million of net revenue related to the 2018 and 2019 federal blender’s credits. Revenue will be recognized ratably during the years 2020 through 2022 based on biodiesel production.
In October 2019, the CT&M segment obtained control of a former non-consolidated affiliate that operates a grain trading business in Peru. On January 5, 2018, the CT&M segment acquired flour milling and associated businesses in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Monaco. See Note 2 for further details of these acquisitions.
The Power segment is currently constructing a power barge for use in the Dominican Republic that is anticipated to begin operations in 2021. Seaboard’s Power segment continues to explore strategic alternatives for the existing barge, including selling, relocating or operating in conjunction with the new barge at the current site. During 2019, the Power segment sold its 29.9% interest in an electricity generation facility. See Note 7 for discussion of the non-consolidated affiliate.
The following tables set forth specific financial information about each segment as reviewed by Seaboard’s management, except for the Turkey segment information previously disclosed in Note 7. Operating income for segment reporting is prepared on the same basis as that used for consolidated operating income. Operating income, along with income (loss) from affiliates for the Pork, CT&M and Turkey segments, are used as the measures of evaluating segment performance because management does not consider interest, other investment income (loss) and income tax expense on a segment

Item 9A.","Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2019, Seaboard’s management has evaluated, under the direction of its chief executive and chief financial officers, the effectiveness of Seaboard’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, Seaboard’s chief executive and chief financial officers concluded that Seaboard’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. It should be noted that any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of any such system, there can be no assurance that any design will always succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of Seaboard is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision, and with the participation of management and its Internal Audit Department, Seaboard conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that Seaboard’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 64.
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -There have been no changes in Seaboard’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Seaboard’s internal control over financial reporting.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Seaboard Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Seaboard Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

718413_2020.htm,718413,2020,"Item 1. The Business
Organization and Operation
The Company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Vermont in 1982 and became a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, in October 1983 when it acquired all of the voting shares of the Bank, headquartered in Derby, Vermont. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company and principally all of the Company’s business operations are presently conducted through it. Therefore, the following narrative and the other information about the Company contained in this report are based primarily on the Bank’s operations.
The Bank; Banking Services. Community National Bank was organized in 1851 as the Peoples Bank, and was subsequently reorganized as the National Bank of Derby Line in 1865. In 1975, after 110 continuous years of operation as the National Bank of Derby Line, the Bank acquired the Island Pond National Bank and changed its name to “Community National Bank.” On December 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of LyndonBank, a Vermont bank headquartered in Lyndonville, Vermont, in a cash merger transaction. As a result of the merger, the Company expanded its existing branch network in Caledonia and Orleans Counties and extended it into Lamoille and Franklin Counties. In addition to its main office in Derby, the Company currently maintains eleven branch offices in northeastern and central Vermont and loan production offices in Chittenden County, in northwestern Vermont, and Grafton County, in western New Hampshire.
The opportunities for growth continue to be primarily in the Central Vermont and Chittenden County markets where economic activity is more robust than in the Company’s Orleans and Caledonia County markets, and where the Company is increasing its presence and market share. The Company is also focusing on expanding its presence in the neighboring state of New Hampshire through the opening of its loan production office in Lebanon, New Hampshire in 2019.
The Company, through the Bank, provides a broad range of loan and deposit services to the residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations and municipalities in its northern and central Vermont markets. Significant services offered by the Company include:
·
Business Banking - The Company offers a range of credit products for a variety of general business purposes, including financing for commercial business properties, equipment, inventories and accounts receivable, as well as letters of credit. The Company also offers business checking and other deposit accounts, cash management services, repurchase agreements, ACH and wire transfer services, card processing and remote deposit capture.
·
Commercial Real Estate Lending - The Company provides a range of products to meet the financing needs of commercial developers and investors, residential builders and developers and community development entities. Credit products are available to facilitate the purchase of land and/or build structures for business use and for investors who are developing residential or commercial property, as well as for real estate secured financing of existing businesses. The Bank has previously been recognized by the SBA as Vermont’s top Section 7(a) program lender, providing financing to startups and other small businesses not eligible for more traditional financing, and as one of Vermont’s top third party small business lenders under the SBA’s Section 504 loan program.
·
Residential Real Estate Lending - The Company provides products to help meet the home financing needs of consumers, including conventional permanent and construction/permanent (fixed, adjustable, or variable rate) financing arrangements, and FHA/VA loan products. The Company offers both fixed-rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage (ARM) loans and home equity loans. A portion of the first lien residential mortgage loans originated by the Company are sold into the secondary market. The Company offers these products through its network of banking and loan production offices. The Company does not originate subprime residential real estate loans.
·
Retail Credit - The Company provides a full-range of loan products to meet the needs of consumers, including personal loans, automobile loans and boat/recreational vehicle loans. In addition, through a marketing alliance with a third party, the Company offers credit cards.
·
Municipal and Institutional Banking - The Company provides banking services to meet the needs of state and local governments, schools, charities, membership and not-for-profit associations including deposit account services, tax-exempt loans, lines of credit and term loans. In addition, through an arrangement with the FHLBB, the Company offers a secured deposit product to its municipal customers, collateralized by FHLBB letters of credit.
·
Retail Banking - The Company provides a full-range of consumer banking services, including checking accounts, savings programs, ATMs, debit/credit cards, night deposit facilities and online, mobile and telephone banking.
The Company focuses on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with customers and is committed to providing for the financial services needs of the communities it serves. In particular, the Company continues to emphasize its relationships with individual customers and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The Company actively evaluates the banking needs of its markets, including low- and moderate-income areas, and offers products that are responsive to the needs of its customer base. The Company’s markets provide a mix of real estate, commercial and industrial, municipal and consumer lending opportunities, as well as a stable core deposit base. Additional information about our business, including the Company’s deposit-taking activities, lending activities and credit and risk management policies, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in the 2020 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Related Trust Company. In 2002, the Bank transferred its trust operations to a newly formed Vermont-chartered non-depository trust and investment management company, CFSG, based in Newport, Vermont. The Bank’s ownership interest in CFSG is held indirectly, through CFS Partners, a Vermont limited liability company, which owns 100% of the limited liability company equity interests of CFSG. Immediately following transfer of its trust operations to CFSG, the Bank sold a two-thirds interest in CFS Partners, equally to the National Bank of Middlebury, headquartered in Middlebury, Vermont and Guaranty Bancorp Inc., the bank holding company parent of Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank, headquartered in Woodsville, New Hampshire. CFSG offers fiduciary services throughout the market areas of the three owner financial institutions and leases space from them in some of their branch offices, including at the Bank’s facilities in Barre and Lyndonville, Vermont.
Statutory Business Trust. In 2007, the Company formed CMTV Statutory Trust I (the Trust), a Delaware statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing $12.5 million of trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company. This funding provided a portion of the cash consideration paid by the Company in the acquisition of LyndonBank and provided additional regulatory capital. The Trust is a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, within the meaning of applicable accounting standards. Accordingly, the Trust is not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.
Competition
All of the Bank’s full-service banking offices are located in northern and central Vermont. The Bank’s main office is located in Derby, in Orleans County. In addition to its main office, the Bank has four other banking offices in Orleans County, one office in Essex County, two offices in Caledonia County, two offices in Washington County and one office each in Franklin and Lamoille Counties. The Bank also maintains loan production offices in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire. (See Part I, Item 2 (Properties) of this report.)
The Bank competes in all aspects of its business with other banks and credit unions in northern and central Vermont, including three of the largest banks operating in the state, which maintain branch offices throughout the Bank’s service area. The Bank also competes with bank and non-bank lenders in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire where it maintains loan production offices. Changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry during the past decade have broadened the competition for commercial bank products, such as deposits and loans, to include not only traditional rivals such as banks, savings banks and credit unions, but also many non-traditional rivals such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual funds and consumer and commercial finance and leasing companies. In addition, many out-of-market nationwide banks, nonbank lenders and other financial service firms operate in the Company’s market areas through mass marketing solicitations by mail, radio, television, the internet and email. At the same time, technological changes have facilitated remote delivery of financial services by bank and nonbank competitors outside the context of a traditional branch bank network, thereby intensifying competition from out-of-market firms. This trend may accelerate, as customers’ use of and reliance on technology for remote delivery of financial services has accelerated as a result of the limitations imposed on in-person banking during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition from the tax-exempt credit union industry has also intensified in recent years. A number of the Bank’s credit union competitors, including the largest state-chartered Vermont credit union, have converted from an employment based common bond to a community common bond, thereby significantly increasing their fields of membership in the Bank’s market areas. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, they have a significant pricing advantage over commercial banks for their deposit and loan products. This pricing advantage, coupled with the relaxing of membership criteria and regulatory restrictions on product offerings, has resulted in increased competition for the Bank from this tax exempt sector of the financial services industry.
In order to compete with other bank and non-bank service providers, the Company stresses the community orientation of its banking operations and relies to a large extent upon personal relationships established by its officers, directors and employees with their customers and on their strong ties to the local community. In addition, management’s knowledge of the local community assists it in tailoring the Company’s products and services to meet the needs of its customer base. Although competition is strong throughout the Company’s market area, management believes that the Company can continue to compete effectively, in view of its local market knowledge and community ties and its understanding of customer needs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any employees at the holding company level. However, as of such date, the Bank employed 126 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. The Bank provides our full-time and part-time employees with a comprehensive employee benefit package, including medical benefits, life insurance and a 401K retirement savings plan. Additionally, full-time employees also have disability insurance as part of their benefit package. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management of the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Supervision
The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks, to which the Company and the Bank are subject. Regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to below. Banking is a highly regulated business and proposals to change the laws and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank is impossible to predict with any certainty.
The following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the particular statutes and regulations.
Bank Holding Company Act. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to on-going regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). A bank holding company for example, must generally obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank. FRB approval is also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property.
The Act generally limits the activity in which the Company and its subsidiaries may engage to certain specified activities, including those activities which the FRB may find, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking are: (1) making and servicing loans that could be made by mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring companies; (2) performing the functions of a trust company; (3) certain leasing of real or personal property; (4) providing certain financial, banking or economic data processing services; (5) except as otherwise prohibited by law, acting as an insurance agent or broker with respect to insurance that is directly related to the extension of credit or the provision of other financial services or, under certain circumstances, with respect to insurance that is sold in certain small communities in which the bank holding company system maintains banking offices; (6) acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance and credit health and accident insurance directly related to extensions of credit by the holding company system; (7) providing certain kinds of management consulting advice to unaffiliated banks and non-bank depository institutions; (8) performing real estate appraisals; (9) issuing and selling money order and similar instruments and travelers checks and selling U.S. Savings Bonds; (10) providing certain securities brokerage and related services for the account of bank customers; (11) underwriting and dealing in certain government obligations and other obligations such as bankers’ acceptances and certificates of deposit; (12) providing consumer financial counseling; (13) providing tax planning and preparation services; (14) providing check guarantee services to merchants; (15) operating a collection agency; and (16) operating a credit bureau. Trust and investment management activities conducted through a non-depository trust company such as the Company’s affiliate, CFSG, are also considered by the FRB to be permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking.
Except for CFSG’s trust and investment management operations, the Company does not presently engage, directly or indirectly through any affiliate, in any other permissible non-banking activities.
A bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval in order to purchase or redeem its own stock if the gross consideration to be paid, when added to the net consideration paid by the company for all purchases or redemptions by the company of its equity securities within the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.
The Company is required to file with the FRB annual and quarterly reports and such additional information as the Board may require pursuant to the Act. The Board may also make examinations of the Company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company.
The Company, the Bank, CFS Partners and CFSG are all considered “affiliates” of each other for the purposes of Section 18(j) of the FDIA, as amended, and Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in on January 1, 2019, for the Company and the Bank.
The Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:
●
a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
●
a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
●
a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, have retained the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, consisting of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company and the Bank satisfied this fully-phased in capital conservation buffer. Failure to maintain the required buffer would result in limitations on permissible shareholder distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
The Company’s capital ratios exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2020. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies adopted an interim rule temporarily lowering the CBLR benchmark to in excess of 8%, rather than 9%, with a phased increase of the CBLR back to the 9% level by the end of 2021. The Company and Bank continued to qualify to utilize the CBLR framework as of December 31, 2020, however, as noted in Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2020, they had not elected to do so.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. SOX was enacted to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. SOX and the SEC’s implementing regulations include provisions addressing, among other matters, the duties, functions and qualifications of audit committees for all public companies; certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except (in the case of banking companies) loans in the normal course of business; expedited filing requirements for reports of beneficial ownership of company stock by insiders; disclosure of a code of ethics for senior officers, and of any change or waiver of such code; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; auditor independence; disclosure of fees paid to the company’s auditors for non-audit services and limitations on the provision of such services; attestation requirements for company management and external auditors, relating to internal controls and procedures; and various increased criminal penalties for violations of federal securities laws.
Since 2007 Section 404 of SOX has required management of the Company to undertake a periodic assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for 2020 is contained in Part II, Item 9A of this Report. Effective December 31, 2020, as a non-accelerated filer for SEC reporting purposes, the Company is no longer required to obtain from its external auditors an attestation on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of these controls under Section 404(b) of SOX. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs in connection with its on-going compliance with Section 404.
Information on the Company’s corporate governance practices, including committee charters, is available on the Company’s website at www.communitybancorpvt.com.
SEC Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. Under current SEC reporting and disclosure rules, as amended in 2018, and 2020, the Company is once again considered to be a non-accelerated filer and a smaller reporting company. As noted above, due to this change in filing status, the Company is no longer subject to the requirements in SOX section 404(b) to obtain an external auditor attestation of management’s assessment of the Company’s internal controls and their effectiveness. In addition, the Company is no longer required to file its periodic reports with the SEC on the accelerated timetable applicable to accelerated filers. As a smaller reporting company, the Company is permitted to make certain reduced (or scaled) financial and other disclosures in its periodic reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC.
Dividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank’s ALL.
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.
The FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.
The CARES Act and Other Initiatives Related to COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which provided approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the CARES Act’s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of financial institutions like the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the FRB and other federal bank regulatory authorities. These rules and other subsequent regulatory initiatives have provided guidance on the implementation, eligibility requirements and terms of the various CARES Act programs, as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. It is possible that Congress will enact additional COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act, including the PPP and guidance on certain TDRs discussed below, as well as other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act amended the SBA’s loan programs to create the PPP, a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans, which bear a mandated fixed annual interest rate of one percent, are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, no collateral or personal guarantees are required. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” (the “CAA”) that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the “HHSB Act”). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. The Bank has participated in both rounds of PPP lending.
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers. The CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that may otherwise be required to be characterized as TDRs and to suspend any related determination if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications are related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurs between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency or January 1, 2022. During 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19. The Bank has followed this guidance in providing relief to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Effect on Regulatory Capital. On September 29, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that neutralizes the regulatory capital and liquidity coverage ratio effects of participating in certain COVID-19 liquidity facilities due to the fact there is no credit or market risk associated with exposures pledged to such facilities. As a result, the final rule supports the flow of credit to households and businesses affected by COVID-19.
Dodd-Frank Act. Although the 2008 financial crisis has now passed, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) will continue to affect the Company’s operations as it represents a comprehensive revision and restructuring of many aspects of the financial services industry. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to reduce systemic risk from large, complex “systemically significant” financial institutions, and thus do not apply to a smaller banking organization such as the Company. Nevertheless, certain of its provisions do directly apply to the Company and others indirectly impact its operations, as the Dodd-Frank Act continues to reshape the financial services environment. Among other things, the Act:
·
Established a new independent agency, the CFPB, with centralized responsibility for implementing and (with respect to large organizations) enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB does not have enforcement or examination authority over smaller banking organizations such as the Company, many of its regulatory standards and mandates apply to them, with enforcement authority vested in other regulatory agencies such as (with respect to the Bank) the OCC;
·
Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial companies on a consolidated basis. These changes prohibit the use of additional trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, but the Company’s existing trust preferred securities are grandfathered;
·
Requires debit card interchange transaction fees charged by large financial institutions to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. The FRB adopted regulations in 2011 establishing such fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limiting restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Although smaller institutions such as the Company are not subject to the interchange fee restrictions, it is possible that, over time, competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace may operate to make the restrictions applicable to them by default;
·
Requires public companies to periodically seek “say on executive pay” and “say on frequency” votes of shareholders, and in some circumstances, a “say on golden parachute” vote of shareholders. These vote requirements first became applicable for the Company’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders, with the next “say on pay” vote scheduled to take place at the 2022 Annual Meeting of shareholders;
·
Allowed depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011;
·
Established by statute the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine mandating holding company financial support of subsidiary insured depository institutions;
·
Eliminated state restrictions on de novo interstate branching;
·
Established new requirements related to residential mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. Many of these provisions have been implemented through CFPB rulemakings;
·
Weakened federal preemption standards for national banks and federal savings associations and their operating subsidiaries by granting states greater authority to enforce consumer protection laws against them;
·
Provided permanent relief for non-accelerated filers, from the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for auditor attestation of management’s assessment of internal controls and their effectiveness;
·
Requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive regulatory approval of an interstate bank acquisition; and
·
Permanently increased the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, changed the FDIC insurance assessment base to assets rather than deposits and increased the reserve ratio for the DIF to ensure the future strength of the fund.
OCC Supervision. As a national banking association, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and federal and state statutes and rules and regulations applicable to national banks. The primary supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by the OCC and must file periodic reports with the OCC containing a complete statement of its financial condition and results of operations. The OCC’s examinations are designed for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.
In 2011, the CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, took over responsibility for implementing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others. However, financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our Bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our Bank subsidiary, the OCC). The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.
Prompt Corrective Action. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements established under FDICIA. Among other things, FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lessor of 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was considered “well capitalized” under FDICIA’s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
Safety and Soundness Regulations. Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify, monitor, and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the safety and soundness regulations include enforcement provisions, including authority for the bank regulatory agencies to require a financial institution in some circumstances to create and implement a compliance plan.
Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, previously all FDIC insured depository institutions were required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The FDIC discontinued collection of these payments in March 2019.
The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment formula for determining deposit insurance premiums and modified certain insurance coverage provisions of the FDIA. The FDIC’s implementing rules, which redefined the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, became effective April 1, 2011. The Bank’s total FDIC insurance assessment for 2020 was $300,643.
The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 the maximum per depositor FDIC insurance amount.
Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA’s prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the “one-way” purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling approximately $4.9 million in exchanged funds and $0 in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits. The Company had $4.2 million in purchased wholesale deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Asset, Liability and Funds Management Policy limits the use of brokered deposits to 5% of total assets.
USA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cooperatively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. The Secretary of the Treasury and federal banking regulators have adopted several regulations to implement these provisions. The Act also amended the federal Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations. As required by law, the Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance program, as well as a customer identification program. (See “BSA/AML Requirements” below.)
BSA/AML Requirements. The Company is subject to a number of AML and regulations as a result of being a U.S.-based financial institution. AML requirements are primarily derived from the BSA, as amended by the USA Patriot Act. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the financial system from being used by criminals to hide illicit proceeds and to impede terrorists’ ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, BSA/AML laws and regulations require financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. The Company maintains an AML program designed to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to AML and anti-terrorist financing initiatives. The AML program provides for a system of internal controls to ensure that appropriate due diligence and, when necessary, enhanced due diligence, including obtaining and maintaining appropriate documentation, is conducted at account opening and updated, as necessary, through the course of the client relationship. The AML program is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the AML program requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the AML program is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Non-compliance with BSA/AML laws or failure to maintain adequate policies and procedures can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a bank merger, bank holding company acquisition or other certain other activities.
AML customer due diligence requirements became effective on May 11, 2018. Among other things, these new regulations require the Company to collect information on the beneficial ownership and controlling person of legal entity clients and to verify their identity.
The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities, or countries, identified as “Specially Designated Nationals,” such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These rules require the blocking of assets held by, and prohibit transfers of property to such individuals, entities or countries. Blocked assets, such as property or bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Company maintains an OFAC program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements.
Financial Privacy. Under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 all financial institutions, including the Company, are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic consumer customer data with nonaffiliated parties, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. The Company is also subject to similar, but more stringent, requirements under state law, including the Vermont Financial Privacy Act. In addition, the Company is subject to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, including the amendments adopted in the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). The FACT Act includes many provisions concerning national credit reporting standards and permits consumers to opt out of information sharing among affiliated companies for marketing purposes. It also requires financial institutions to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit terms less favorable than those generally available. The CFPB has extensive rulemaking authority under the FACT Act and has promulgated rules implementing the Act, including rules limiting information sharing for affiliate marketing and rules requiring programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Vermont Fair Credit Reporting Act, which generally requires an individual’s consent in order to obtain a credit report.
Qualified Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB adopted significant amendments to the regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act. These amendments became effective in January 2014, and address mortgage origination practices by certain housing creditors, including the Bank. These 2014 regulations generally require mortgage lenders to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate so-called qualified mortgages, or “QMs”, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, under the 2014 regulations, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, the points and fees paid by a consumer do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio is no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency).
In December, 2020, the CFPB adopted two rules significantly revising the QM requirements. Among other changes, the first of the new rules simplifies the definition of a QM by creating conclusive and rebuttable presumptions regarding the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the rule, a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate (APR) does not exceed the average prime offer rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set. A loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate exceeds the APOR for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more but by less than 2.25 percentage points. The second of the new CFPB rules creates a new category of “Seasoned QMs” for first-lien, fixed-rate covered transactions that have met certain performance requirements, are held in portfolio by the originating creditor or first purchaser for a 36-month period, comply with general restrictions on product features and points and fees, and meet certain underwriting requirements. A mortgage loan that qualifies as a Seasoned QM loan will receive a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements. The new rules became effective on March 1, 2021, with an initial mandatory effective date of July 1, 2021. On March 3, 2021 the CFPB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to extend the mandatory compliance date to October 1, 2021.
A lender originating a QM is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay requirement, whereas a lender originating a mortgage that is not a QM is exposed to the risk of a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules. Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rules could require the lender to pay damages to the borrower, and could impair the lender’s ability to enforce the loan terms or foreclose on the real estate collateral.
Integrated TILA/RESPA (TRID) Disclosures. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued rules revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the RESPA and TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective in October 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate (which combines content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA) not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure (which combines content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA) at least three days prior to the loan closing. Other significant changes included in the TRID rules include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures. As with the CFPB’s ability-to-repay/QM rules, compliance with the TRID rules has increased the Company’s compliance costs and may adversely affect the profitability of our routine residential mortgage lending operations.
Community Reinvestment Act. The federal CRArequires banks to define the communities they serve, identify the credit needs of those communities, collect and maintain data for each small business or small farm loan originated or purchased by the Bank, and maintain a public file at each location. The federal banking regulators examine the institutions they regulate to assess their record of meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, and assign one of the following four ratings: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance”. As of the Bank’s last CRA examination, completed by the OCC during 2020, it received a rating of “Outstanding”.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The federal HMDA, which is implemented by CFPB’s Regulation C, requires mortgage lenders that maintain offices within MSAs to report and make available to the public specified information regarding their residential mortgage lending activities, such as the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the “rate spread” between the interest rate on loans and certain treasury securities and other benchmarks. The Bank became subject to HMDA reporting requirements as a result of its merger with LyndonBank in 2007, as the former LyndonBank branch in Enosburg Falls in Franklin County is included within the Burlington, Vermont MSA. The CFPB’s HMDA rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, many consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit. HMDA rule amendments that became effective January 1, 2018 significantly increased the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. However, the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provided an exemption from the requirement to collect these additional data fields for banks that have at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating that originate fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans or fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit per year. The Bank qualifies for this relief.
Flood Insurance Reform. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
In July 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires certain lenders to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. New rules effective July 1, 2019, require banks and other regulated financial institutions to accept certain private insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies.
Reserve Requirements. FRB Regulation D requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (generally, demand deposits, NOW accounts and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties) and non-personal time deposits (generally, money market deposit accounts or other savings deposits held by corporations or other depositors that are not natural persons, and certain other types of time deposits), subject to certain exemptions, at a level established by the FRB. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at the FRBB or a pass through account (as defined by the FRB), the effect of maintaining required reserves is to reduce the amount of the Company’s interest-bearing assets. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the required reserve ratio to 0 percent, thereby eliminating the reserve requirement. However, the FRB retains the authority to reimpose a reserve requirement in the future.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the applicable regional FHLB (the FHLBB, in the case of the Bank), in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year and 4.5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLBB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock at December 31, 2020 of $768,400. As a member, the Bank is subject to future capital calls by the FHLBB in order to maintain compliance with its capital plan.
FRB Executive Compensation Guidelines. The FRB has issued comprehensive guidance on executive compensation policies, intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially an institution’s risk profile, either individually or as part of a group, and establishes that incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to identify and manage effectively; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. The guidance instructed institutions to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and implement corrective programs as needed. Where deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements exist, they must be immediately addressed. For institutions such as the Company that are not “large, complex banking organizations” as defined in the guidance, the FRB will review the incentive compensation arrangements as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process and not in a separate examination. These examinations will be tailored to the scope and complexity of the institution’s activity and compensation arrangements. The findings will be included in the FRB’s examination report and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the institution fails to take prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. In addition to the statutes, regulations and regulatory initiatives described above, new legislation and regulations affecting financial institutions are frequently proposed. If enacted or adopted, these measures could change banking statutes and the Company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and could further increase reporting and compliance requirements, governance structures and costs of doing business. The Company cannot predict whether any such additional legislation or other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or the effect they may have on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money supply, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government Securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings, setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits, regulating interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits and expanding or contracting the money supply. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Before deciding to invest in the Company or to maintain or increase an investment, investors should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below and in the Company’s other filings with the SEC are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that are currently deemed immaterial may emerge or evolve and also affect the Company’s business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which in turn could result in a decline in the value of the Company’s capital stock.
ECOMONIC AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS
The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive to us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be significant. Moreover, the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and out of our control, and will be affected by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the national and global economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 initially caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of business and social events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability throughout our Vermont markets and nationwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Vermont, as well as the governments in most other states, took preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including, among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, real estate and the health care industry, and resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees in Vermont and nationwide.
Although we continued operating during mandated shutdowns in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions in the future. Impacts to our business have included the implementation of additional health and safety precautions at our banking offices, the transition of a portion of our workforce to home locations, curtailed in-branch services, increases in customers’ inability to make scheduled loan payments, increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications, and an adverse effect on accounting estimates that we use to determine our provision and allowance for loan losses.
While the CARES Act signed into law in March, 2020 provided fast and direct economic assistance for American workers, families, and small businesses during 2020, helping to minimize the immediate impact of the pandemic, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the broader economy and our markets are not known, nor is the ultimate duration or impacts of the economic and social restrictions resulting from government mitigation efforts. Moreover, the responsive actions taken by the FRB to lower the federal funds rate has negatively affected our interest income and, therefore, may adversely affect our earnings, financial condition, results of operation and prospects in future periods. Additional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:
●
decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings;
●
declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral resulting in higher loan losses;
●
declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;
●
declines in demand resulting from businesses and individuals suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets.
●
our employees contracting COVID-19;
●
reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;
●
a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;
●
unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;
●
effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;
●
sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;
●
declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;
●
substantial increases in unemployment in our markets;
●
reduced consumer spending due to job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;
●
unprecedented volatility in U.S. financial markets ;and
●
volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio.
These factors, together or in combination with other factors, events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, in both the short-term and the long-term. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may continue to materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services, and could negatively impact, among other things, our asset quality, liquidity, regulatory capital, net income and growth prospects.
Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FRB lowered the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25%. It is unclear how long this historically low target federal funds rate will remain in effect. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may compress, reducing our net interest income and adversely affecting our operating results. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.
Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates.
In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, as discussed below, there is uncertainty as to our future interest costs on our subordinated debentures due to the scheduled phase out of LIBOR at the end of 2021. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.
Our interest costs may increase as a result of the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a reference rate for interest payments on our subordinated debentures.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that LIBOR would no longer be published, with an expected target date of December 31, 2021 for the phase out. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced firm target dates for the phase out of various LIBOR settings, including a phase out date of June 30, 2023 for 3-month LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a “benchmark” or “reference rate” for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are significant conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal Financial Stability Oversight Committee has stated that the end or waning use of LIBOR has the potential to significantly disrupt trading in many important types of financial contracts.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding $12,887,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2037, which bear a quarterly floating rate of interest equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus 2.85%. Under the terms of the Indenture, if 3-month LIBOR is not available, the Trustee may obtain substitute quotations from four leading banks in the London interbank market for their offered rate to prime banks in the London market for U.S. dollar deposits having a three month maturity; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are received, the Trustee will request substitute quotations from four major New York City banks for their offered rate to leading European banks for loans in U.S. dollars; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. The Debenture Trustee has not yet informed the Company as to how it intends to proceed. Phase out of LIBOR, including the Debenture Trustee’s implementation of the foregoing provisions, could significantly impact the Company’s interest costs on its Debentures and it is not possible to predict the magnitude of any such increase.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
As a participating lender in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), the Company is subject to additional risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties and risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding the processing of PPP loans.
We are a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We originated $105.0 million in PPP loans during 2020, of which $64.3 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020, and we continue to make new loans during 2021 under the PPP, as extended by the CAA. Under the PPP, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the program. There is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, some other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any financial liability, regulatory enforcement, litigation costs or reputational damage stemming from our participation in the PPP and any related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan. If the SBA identifies a deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty for the affected loan or loans, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.
We are subject to liquidity risk because we rely primarily on deposit-gathering to satisfy our funding needs.
Our primary source of liquidity is through the growth of deposits, which provide low cost funding for our operations. If we are unable to attract enough deposits in our market area to fund loan growth and our other funding needs, then we may be forced to purchase deposits or to borrow through the FHLBB or in the capital markets. Purchased deposits and borrowings would tend to be more expensive than funding through core deposits and therefore could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and regulatory capital levels.
We are subject to credit risk and if our ALL is not adequate to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.
We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower’s default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the credit. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In loan default situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan, through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan could exceed the value of the collateral acquired.
We periodically make a determination of the adequacy of our ALL based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by loan risk ratings, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accruing and criticized loans. Management relies on its loan officers and credit quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the provision required for the allowance. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, previously incorrect assumptions, an increase in defaulted loans, or other pertinent factors, we determine that additional increases in the ALL are necessary, additional expenses may be incurred. During 2020, in evaluating our ALL we downgraded certain qualitative factors and shortened our historical lookback period from five years to one year, in light of the adverse economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Determining the amount of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. At any time, we are likely to have loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. The OCC, our subsidiary Bank’s primary federal regulator, reviews the loan portfolio from time to time as part of its regulatory examination and may request that we increase the ALL. Changes in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, we will need to make additional provisions to restore the allowance. Any provisions to increase or restore the ALL would decrease our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Implementation of CECL could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements upon adoption as it may result in the recording of an increased ALL amount, with a related adverse impact on the calculation of the Company’s regulatory capital ratios. Adoption of the CECL model will become mandatory for the Company beginning with the 2023 fiscal year.
Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.
Generally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers’ discretion and may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including changes in prevailing interest rates. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. The prevailing low interest rates increase our prepayment risk. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our loans and deposits are geographically concentrated and adverse local economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
Unlike many larger banking institutions, our banking operations are not geographically diversified. Substantially all of our loans, deposits and fee income are generated in northeastern and central Vermont. As a result, poor economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont could adversely and significantly impact the demand for loans and our other financial products and services and may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. Much of our market area is located in the poorest region of the state. Economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont are subject to various uncertainties, to a greater degree than certain other regions of the state. If economic conditions in our market area decline, we expect that our level of problem assets would increase and our prospects for growth would be impaired.
Systems failures, interruptions, cyberattacks or other breaches of information security, including those affecting our vendors, could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
We depend upon data processing, software, communication, and information access and exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Consequently, we are subject to certain related operational risks, both in our operations and through those of our service providers. These risks include, but are not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud, cyberattacks and catastrophic failures resulting from civil unrest, terrorist acts or natural disasters. Despite the safeguards we maintain, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. Information security risks have increased significantly due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking channels by customers and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Our technologies, systems and networks and those of certain of our service providers as well as our customers’ devices, may be the target of cyberattacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, the theft of customer assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and we could be exposed to claims from customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition. While we have instituted safeguards and controls, we cannot provide assurance that they will be effective in all cases, and their failure in some circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.
In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate or incomplete, we may suffer financial or reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.
Environmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.
In the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
REGULATORY, LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING RISKS
Our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and to service our debt depends primarily on dividends from our subsidiary and may be subject to regulatory and contractual limitations.
As a holding company, our cash flow typically comes from dividends that our bank subsidiary, Community National Bank, pays to us. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and to service our subordinated debentures, depends on the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to federal statutory and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings and may be subject to additional prudential considerations, such as capital planning needs. In addition, FRB policy, which applies to us as a registered bank holding company, provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period and should not be paid if regulatory capital levels are deemed insufficient. Further, regulatory capital requirements could curtail our ability to pay dividends in some cases if we do not maintain a required capital conservation buffer. Our failure to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or our failure to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if sufficient dividend funding from the Bank is not available to cover all our requirements, we would be obligated first to pay interest and, if applicable, principal on our debentures and then to pay dividends on our preferred stock before making any dividend payments on our common stock.
Although we have generally paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future or that the dividend rate will not be reduced in future periods.
Our banking business is highly regulated, and we may be adversely affected by changes in law and regulation.
We are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCC. Federal laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital, the permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The OCC possesses the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to its supervision, and the FRB possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. We are also subject to certain state laws, including certain Vermont laws designed to protect consumers of banking products and services. These and other federal and state laws and restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.
Our business is highly regulated and the various federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance, policies and interpretations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. It is impossible to predict the nature of such changes or their competitive impact on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our banking operations in particular. Such changes may, among other things, increase our cost of doing business, limit our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, litigation by private parties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.
We report certain assets, including investment securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. For example, we could be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.
Changes in accounting standards could materially affect our financial statements.
From time to time FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements and applicable disclosures in our SEC filings. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Implementation of accounting changes, with associated professional consultation and advice, can be costly, even if the change will not have any material effect on our financial statements.
Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management has designed and implemented, and periodically reviews and updates, our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. However, any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to detailed capital requirements and cannot ensure that we will qualify for simplified capital calculations in any future period.
As of January 1, 2015, we were required to comply with the Base III capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The capital rules require the Bank and the Company to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions in order to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2020. The Base III capital rules permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. Our trust preferred securities qualify for this grandfather treatment. The rules also increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations, but retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. These standards could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Under the rules, we were permitted to make, and did make, a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital.
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020 and although the Company and Bank qualify to utilize the CBLR framework at December 31, 2020, management has not elected to do so at this time.
We may be required to write down goodwill.
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill totaled approximately $11.6 million, created in connection with the LyndonBank acquisition in 2007. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of this asset to fair value. We conduct a review each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We last completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2020, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK
Our common stock is not exchange-listed and our trading volume is less than that of larger public companies, which can contribute to volatility in our stock price and adversely affect the price and liquidity of an investment in our common stock.
Our common stock is included in the OTC QX market tier maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the trading symbol CMTV, but is not traded on any securities exchange. Bid and ask quotations and trades in our stock made by certain brokerage firms are reported through the OTC Link® Alternative Trading System (ATS) maintained by a subsidiary of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. However, trading in our stock is sporadic. A public trading market for a particular class of stock having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of numerous buyers and sellers of that stock at any given time, which in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which issuers have no control. The trading market in our stock does not exhibit these characteristics. The trading history of our common stock has been characterized by relatively low trading volume. This lack of an active public market means that the value of a shareholder’s investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden and exaggerated fluctuations, as individual trades have a greater effect on our reported trading price than would be the case in a broad public market with significant daily trading volume.
The market price of our common stock may also be subject to fluctuations in response to numerous other factors, including the other factors discussed in this report, regardless of our actual operating performance. The possibility of such fluctuations occurring is increased due to the illiquid nature of the trading market in our common stock. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to sell our common stock at or above the price at which it was purchased, or at or above the current market price or at the time of his or her choosing. This illiquid trading market also makes it particularly difficult for a shareholder to dispose of a large number of shares of our stock at desired pricing or on a desired timetable.
Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock.
Shares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our common stock ranks junior to all our customer deposits and other indebtedness, including our subordinated debentures, whether now existing or hereafter incurred, and other non-equity claims on us, with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. In addition, our common stock is junior in priority, including with respect to dividend and liquidation rights, to our outstanding shares of Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. Further, the common stock will be subject to the prior liquidation rights of the holders of any debt we may issue in the future and may be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or other deposit accounts or obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the DIF or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.
Our organizational documents may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us.
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Association and By-Laws contain provisions, including a staggered board of directors and a supermajority vote requirement for certain acquisition transactions and other matters, that make it more difficult for a third party to gain control or acquire us without the consent of the board of directors. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for dissident shareholders to elect representatives as directors and take other corporate actions. To the extent that these provisions make these actions more difficult and make us a less attractive takeover candidate, they may not always be in our best interests or in the best interests of our shareholders, and in some circumstances may prevent holders of our common stock from receiving a takeover premium.
GENERAL RISKS
Market changes in delivery of financial services may adversely affect demand for our services.
Channels for delivering financial products and services to our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities and more use of online and mobile banking. We compete with larger providers that have significant resources to dedicate to improved technology and delivery channels. We periodically evaluate the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities to improve efficiencies. However, identification and closure of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.
Substantial competition could adversely affect us.
Banking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in northeastern and central Vermont. Our competitors include a number of state and national banks and tax-advantaged credit unions, as well as financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those that we offer. Some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions. Our large bank competitors, in particular, have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources that are well in excess of ours. These larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost and have a higher per-borrower lending limit than our Company, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with them effectively.
In addition, technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically, without the need for a physical presence in a market area. We are therefore likely to face increasing competition from out-of-market competitors, including national firms. Moreover, in many cases transactions may now be completed without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the Internet and by telephone without banks. Many non-bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints. If consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions, we could potentially lose fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits.
New products and services are essential to remain competitive but may subject us to additional risks.
We consistently attempt to offer new products and services to our customers to remain competitive. There can be risks and uncertainties associated with these new products and services especially if they are dependent on new technologies. We may spend significant time and resources in development of new products and services to market to customers. Through our development and implementation process we may incur risks associated with delivery timetables, pricing and profitability, compliance with regulations, technology failures and shifting customer preferences. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material effect on our financial condition, result of operations and business.
Changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.
Our future effective tax rates and tax liabilities could be unfavorably affected by increases in applicable tax rates and by other changes in federal or state tax laws, regulations and agency interpretations. Our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by the outcomes of any examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS or our state income, franchise, sales and use or other tax returns by the Vermont Department of Taxes. Our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected in the short-term by decreases in applicable tax rates that require us to revalue our deferred tax asset, as occurred in 2017 as a result of passage of the 2017 Tax Act.
Our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled personnel.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including executives. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense and our geographic market area might not be favorably perceived by potential executive management candidates. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key personnel.
We are not able to offer all of the financial services and products of a financial holding company.
Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can now combine under a “financial holding company” umbrella. Financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Some of our competitors have elected to become financial holding companies. We offer only traditional banking products and, trust and investment management services indirectly through, our affiliate, CFSG.
